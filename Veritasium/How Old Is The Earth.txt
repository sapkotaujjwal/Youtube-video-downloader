which is actually not a sound but sound which is actually not a sound but a fjord so one question you might ask is a fjord so one question you might ask is a fjord so one question you might ask is what is the Fjord well the answer is what is the Fjord well the answer is what is the Fjord well the answer is it's a giant Channel carved out of the it's a giant Channel carved out of the it's a giant Channel carved out of the Rock and it was carved by glaciers so Rock and it was carved by glaciers so Rock and it was carved by glaciers so ice moving down through here at ice moving down through here at ice moving down through here at incredibly slow speeds how long do you incredibly slow speeds how long do you incredibly slow speeds how long do you reckon it would take a glacia to like reckon it would take a glacia to like reckon it would take a glacia to like carve out a valley like Milford millions carve out a valley like Milford millions carve out a valley like Milford millions of years yeah easily easily Millions so of years yeah easily easily Millions so of years yeah easily easily Millions so I've been going around asking people how I've been going around asking people how I've been going around asking people how old is the Earth wow that's a good old is the Earth wow that's a good old is the Earth wow that's a good question I'm not really sure we should question I'm not really sure we should question I'm not really sure we should know this oh good question know this oh good question know this oh good question um millions of I'd say probably I don't um millions of I'd say probably I don't um millions of I'd say probably I don't know millions of years old maybe four know millions of years old maybe four know millions of years old maybe four four five millions of years couple of four five millions of years couple of four five millions of years couple of million years old oh millions millions million years old oh millions millions million years old oh millions millions of of of years 2.3 million No 3 million 3.2 years 2.3 million No 3 million 3.2 years 2.3 million No 3 million 3.2 million do I hear four do I hear four million do I hear four do I hear four million do I hear four do I hear four million it's a million 10 million it's a million 10 million it's a million 10 million 20 milli million nice I like how million 20 milli million nice I like how million 20 milli million nice I like how you doubled them down that that was good you doubled them down that that was good you doubled them down that that was good I thought it was 36 million 46 million I thought it was 36 million 46 million I thought it was 36 million 46 million 40 billion oh I'd say like three or four 40 billion oh I'd say like three or four 40 billion oh I'd say like three or four months months months right millions and right millions and right millions and millions a billion years old couple millions a billion years old couple millions a billion years old couple billion years old 4 billion years old 4 billion years old 4 billion billion billion 4.2 billions billions years yeah like 4.2 billions billions years yeah like 4.2 billions billions years yeah like this so the answer is it's 4 and A2 this so the answer is it's 4 and A2 this so the answer is it's 4 and A2 billion years old that's really quite a billion years old that's really quite a billion years old that's really quite a long time but I think to most people the long time but I think to most people the long time but I think to most people the difference between a million years and a difference between a million years and a difference between a million years and a billion years is uh well it's difficult billion years is uh well it's difficult billion years is uh well it's difficult to imagine so let's try to put this in to imagine so let's try to put this in to imagine so let's try to put this in perspective if you imagine that uh my perspective if you imagine that uh my perspective if you imagine that uh my armspan is the history of the Earth with armspan is the history of the Earth with armspan is the history of the Earth with the starting of the Earth at the tip of the starting of the Earth at the tip of the starting of the Earth at the tip of my uh right fingers then well life would my uh right fingers then well life would my uh right fingers then well life would have formed somewhere around my right have formed somewhere around my right have formed somewhere around my right forearm but from there all the way up to forearm but from there all the way up to forearm but from there all the way up to oh about my left forearm only we only oh about my left forearm only we only oh about my left forearm only we only had single celled uh creatures then just had single celled uh creatures then just had single celled uh creatures then just before my left wrist we get the first before my left wrist we get the first before my left wrist we get the first fish then amphibians dinosaurs around my fish then amphibians dinosaurs around my fish then amphibians dinosaurs around my uh left palm and finally mammals around uh left palm and finally mammals around uh left palm and finally mammals around the base of my fingers now dinosaurs the base of my fingers now dinosaurs the base of my fingers now dinosaurs lived up until the uh second knuckle on lived up until the uh second knuckle on lived up until the uh second knuckle on my uh on my right middle finger and my uh on my right middle finger and my uh on my right middle finger and humans have only been around for well humans have only been around for well humans have only been around for well basically the very tip of uh of my basically the very tip of uh of my basically the very tip of uh of my middle finger so if you think about the middle finger so if you think about the middle finger so if you think about the scale of the uh the Earth's evolution on scale of the uh the Earth's evolution on scale of the uh the Earth's evolution on on that time scale humans have been here on that time scale humans have been here on that time scale humans have been here a very short time and in fact the Earth a very short time and in fact the Earth a very short time and in fact the Earth has been here uh for a huge period of has been here uh for a huge period of has been here uh for a huge period of Time 4 and a half billion years
