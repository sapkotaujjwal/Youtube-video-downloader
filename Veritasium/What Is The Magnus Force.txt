WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so I'm back at the University of Sydney so I'm back at the University of Sydney so I'm back at the University of Sydney with Rod cross hi Derek and today we're with Rod cross hi Derek and today we're with Rod cross hi Derek and today we're talking about the effects of air on talking about the effects of air on talking about the effects of air on projectiles we are now normally we projectiles we are now normally we projectiles we are now normally we neglect these effects when I'm teaching neglect these effects when I'm teaching neglect these effects when I'm teaching students about projectiles I tell them students about projectiles I tell them students about projectiles I tell them forget about the air let's just talk forget about the air let's just talk forget about the air let's just talk about gravity because it simplifies the about gravity because it simplifies the about gravity because it simplifies the problem but air is real it's heavy stuff problem but air is real it's heavy stuff problem but air is real it's heavy stuff and it affects the flight of all and it affects the flight of all and it affects the flight of all projectiles all right well why don't we projectiles all right well why don't we projectiles all right well why don't we do a little experiment to show the do a little experiment to show the do a little experiment to show the effect that air can have this is a effect that air can have this is a effect that air can have this is a surprising experiment that we've set up surprising experiment that we've set up surprising experiment that we've set up here first of all I'll show you what here first of all I'll show you what here first of all I'll show you what happens to a tennis ball when it rolls happens to a tennis ball when it rolls happens to a tennis ball when it rolls down this inclined ramp well that falls exactly like I ramp well that falls exactly like I ramp well that falls exactly like I would expect basically a parabolic path would expect basically a parabolic path would expect basically a parabolic path as as predicted but let's try something as as predicted but let's try something as as predicted but let's try something a little bit lighter such as this paper a little bit lighter such as this paper a little bit lighter such as this paper cylinder okay it weighs only a gram or cylinder okay it weighs only a gram or cylinder okay it weighs only a gram or so the effect of the air will be more so the effect of the air will be more so the effect of the air will be more important Watch What Happens this time important Watch What Happens this time important Watch What Happens this time okay wa so the paper cylinder goes okay wa so the paper cylinder goes okay wa so the paper cylinder goes backwards that doesn't make any sense I backwards that doesn't make any sense I backwards that doesn't make any sense I mean it was rolling forwards off that r mean it was rolling forwards off that r mean it was rolling forwards off that r no it does it every time and it's no it does it every time and it's no it does it every time and it's because of an effect known as the Magnus because of an effect known as the Magnus because of an effect known as the Magnus Force that's acting on the spinning Force that's acting on the spinning Force that's acting on the spinning cylinder acts on a spinning ball as well cylinder acts on a spinning ball as well cylinder acts on a spinning ball as well and people who play sport know about it and people who play sport know about it and people who play sport know about it but they wouldn't call it a Magnus Force but they wouldn't call it a Magnus Force but they wouldn't call it a Magnus Force why is it called the Magnus Force why is it called the Magnus Force why is it called the Magnus Force because Magnus was the first guy who because Magnus was the first guy who because Magnus was the first guy who discovered it when he was investigating discovered it when he was investigating discovered it when he was investigating why cannonballs curve as they propagate why cannonballs curve as they propagate why cannonballs curve as they propagate through the air ahuh and so what did he through the air ahuh and so what did he through the air ahuh and so what did he find out what he found is that when a a find out what he found is that when a a find out what he found is that when a a wall or any object is spinning like this wall or any object is spinning like this wall or any object is spinning like this there's a force perpendicular to the there's a force perpendicular to the there's a force perpendicular to the spin axis if it's spinning clockwise or spin axis if it's spinning clockwise or spin axis if it's spinning clockwise or it Top Spin the force is down if it's it Top Spin the force is down if it's it Top Spin the force is down if it's spinning anticlockwise counterclockwise spinning anticlockwise counterclockwise spinning anticlockwise counterclockwise the force is up so how do we get a the force is up so how do we get a the force is up so how do we get a Magnus force on a ball as the ball's Magnus force on a ball as the ball's Magnus force on a ball as the ball's moving forward through the air if it's moving forward through the air if it's moving forward through the air if it's spinning the air is Flowing around the spinning the air is Flowing around the spinning the air is Flowing around the ball from the front to the back the ball ball from the front to the back the ball ball from the front to the back the ball is spinning in the same direction as the is spinning in the same direction as the is spinning in the same direction as the air flow at the top of the ball but in air flow at the top of the ball but in air flow at the top of the ball but in the opposite direction at the bottom the opposite direction at the bottom the opposite direction at the bottom because of friction between the air and because of friction between the air and because of friction between the air and the ball surface air is dragged around the ball surface air is dragged around the ball surface air is dragged around the top of the ball downwards towards the top of the ball downwards towards the top of the ball downwards towards the back but at the bottom of the ball the back but at the bottom of the ball the back but at the bottom of the ball the air flow in the ball opposite the air flow in the ball opposite the air flow in the ball opposite directions the air comes to a screeching directions the air comes to a screeching directions the air comes to a screeching halt fairly soon instead of being halt fairly soon instead of being halt fairly soon instead of being deflected upwards the net result is air deflected upwards the net result is air deflected upwards the net result is air is deflected downwards due to Newton's is deflected downwards due to Newton's is deflected downwards due to Newton's third law the air exerts an equal third law the air exerts an equal third law the air exerts an equal opposite force on the ball which is opposite force on the ball which is opposite force on the ball which is upwards so how would sports players take upwards so how would sports players take upwards so how would sports players take advantage of the Magnus Force advantage of the Magnus Force advantage of the Magnus Force they make the ball curve through the air they make the ball curve through the air they make the ball curve through the air by a different amount than that due to by a different amount than that due to by a different amount than that due to gravity alone so a golfer will uh strike gravity alone so a golfer will uh strike gravity alone so a golfer will uh strike a golf ball with backspin that exerts a a golf ball with backspin that exerts a a golf ball with backspin that exerts a vertical force a lift force on the ball vertical force a lift force on the ball vertical force a lift force on the ball that keeps it in the air for a longer that keeps it in the air for a longer that keeps it in the air for a longer time and therefore it travels further MH time and therefore it travels further MH time and therefore it travels further MH a tennis player will hit the ball with a tennis player will hit the ball with a tennis player will hit the ball with Top Spin that causes the ball to curve Top Spin that causes the ball to curve Top Spin that causes the ball to curve down onto the court after it pares the down onto the court after it pares the down onto the court after it pares the net uh a baseball or Cricket play net uh a baseball or Cricket play net uh a baseball or Cricket play will also do that but in addition they will also do that but in addition they will also do that but in addition they can make a ball curve about a vertical can make a ball curve about a vertical can make a ball curve about a vertical axis in which case the ball will either axis in which case the ball will either axis in which case the ball will either curve to the left or to the right away curve to the left or to the right away curve to the left or to the right away from the batter making it much more from the batter making it much more from the batter making it much more difficult to hit the ball that's the difficult to hit the ball that's the difficult to hit the ball that's the object of the exercise I see so are object of the exercise I see so are object of the exercise I see so are there any other air effects that we need there any other air effects that we need there any other air effects that we need to be aware of uh there's quite a few to be aware of uh there's quite a few to be aware of uh there's quite a few actually there's the buoyant force actually there's the buoyant force actually there's the buoyant force acting on a balloon for example or any acting on a balloon for example or any acting on a balloon for example or any object there's a drag force acting object there's a drag force acting object there's a drag force acting backwards that slows the ball down and backwards that slows the ball down and backwards that slows the ball down and if the ball happens to have seams then if the ball happens to have seams then if the ball happens to have seams then there a sod force acting on the ball there a sod force acting on the ball there a sod force acting on the ball uhuh well that sounds like a whole uhuh well that sounds like a whole uhuh well that sounds like a whole another episode balls with seams yeah another episode balls with seams yeah another episode balls with seams yeah that is all right well stay tuned if you that is all right well stay tuned if you that is all right well stay tuned if you want to find out how air affects balls want to find out how air affects balls want to find out how air affects balls with seams
