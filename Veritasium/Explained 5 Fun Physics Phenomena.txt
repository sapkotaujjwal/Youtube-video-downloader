WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en in my last video I showed you five fun in my last video I showed you five fun in my last video I showed you five fun physics phenomena and asked you how they physics phenomena and asked you how they physics phenomena and asked you how they work you responded with thousands of work you responded with thousands of work you responded with thousands of comments and some video responses well comments and some video responses well comments and some video responses well here are my explanations let's start here are my explanations let's start here are my explanations let's start with the cereal because it seems the with the cereal because it seems the with the cereal because it seems the simplest but it turns out to be one of simplest but it turns out to be one of simplest but it turns out to be one of the most surprising the simple the most surprising the simple the most surprising the simple explanation goes like this so I showed explanation goes like this so I showed explanation goes like this so I showed you cereal is magnetic I have ground up you cereal is magnetic I have ground up you cereal is magnetic I have ground up all of this cereal into a very fine all of this cereal into a very fine all of this cereal into a very fine pattern let us see what is in it I'm pattern let us see what is in it I'm pattern let us see what is in it I'm going to take these strong magnets and going to take these strong magnets and going to take these strong magnets and run them over the cereal powder and see run them over the cereal powder and see run them over the cereal powder and see if anything is attracted to them look if anything is attracted to them look if anything is attracted to them look how the cereal actually sticks to the how the cereal actually sticks to the how the cereal actually sticks to the magnet and it's because there's pieces magnet and it's because there's pieces magnet and it's because there's pieces of iron in this cereal they've been of iron in this cereal they've been of iron in this cereal they've been added because iron is something we need added because iron is something we need added because iron is something we need it's an essential nutrient that we need it's an essential nutrient that we need it's an essential nutrient that we need to survive in fact this cereal has 60% to survive in fact this cereal has 60% to survive in fact this cereal has 60% of your recommended daily intake of iron of your recommended daily intake of iron of your recommended daily intake of iron but there's more to it I received a but there's more to it I received a but there's more to it I received a video response from Martin be showing video response from Martin be showing video response from Martin be showing non-magnetic objects like plastic and non-magnetic objects like plastic and non-magnetic objects like plastic and paper also apparently being attracted to paper also apparently being attracted to paper also apparently being attracted to a magnet so how does this work well a magnet so how does this work well a magnet so how does this work well water is diamagnetic which means in the water is diamagnetic which means in the water is diamagnetic which means in the presence of a magnetic field it presence of a magnetic field it presence of a magnetic field it generates its own magnetic field in the generates its own magnetic field in the generates its own magnetic field in the opposite direction this means the water opposite direction this means the water opposite direction this means the water is very slightly repelled by the magnet is very slightly repelled by the magnet is very slightly repelled by the magnet and this causes a depression in the and this causes a depression in the and this causes a depression in the surface of the water into which a surface of the water into which a surface of the water into which a floating object will slide you can even floating object will slide you can even floating object will slide you can even see this depression by looking at the see this depression by looking at the see this depression by looking at the reflections off the water So Cal is attracted to a magnet due to So Cal is attracted to a magnet due to So Cal is attracted to a magnet due to its iron content but when floating on its iron content but when floating on its iron content but when floating on the surface of water there is an the surface of water there is an the surface of water there is an additional effect the depression of the additional effect the depression of the additional effect the depression of the water surface due to its water surface due to its water surface due to its diamagnetism I showed you that you can diamagnetism I showed you that you can diamagnetism I showed you that you can find the center of mass of a Cane or find the center of mass of a Cane or find the center of mass of a Cane or another stick type object just by moving another stick type object just by moving another stick type object just by moving your fingers in towards the middle from your fingers in towards the middle from your fingers in towards the middle from the outside but how does this work even the outside but how does this work even the outside but how does this work even when you start in say an asymmetric when you start in say an asymmetric when you start in say an asymmetric position well one finger is closer to position well one finger is closer to position well one finger is closer to the center mass and therefore it carries the center mass and therefore it carries the center mass and therefore it carries more of the weight of the cane and so more of the weight of the cane and so more of the weight of the cane and so the friction force between your finger the friction force between your finger the friction force between your finger and the cane is greater until the point and the cane is greater until the point and the cane is greater until the point where the other finger catches up which where the other finger catches up which where the other finger catches up which point this finger slides in and point this finger slides in and point this finger slides in and eventually they must meet in the middle eventually they must meet in the middle eventually they must meet in the middle so this is a way you can find the center so this is a way you can find the center so this is a way you can find the center of mass of any cane or Canik of mass of any cane or Canik of mass of any cane or Canik object I showed you that if you try to object I showed you that if you try to object I showed you that if you try to flip your phone end overend there is no flip your phone end overend there is no flip your phone end overend there is no way to do it without it also rotating way to do it without it also rotating way to do it without it also rotating around the short axis as well well why around the short axis as well well why around the short axis as well well why is that the phone has three axes about is that the phone has three axes about is that the phone has three axes about which it can rotate there is the long which it can rotate there is the long which it can rotate there is the long axis which has the maximum moment of axis which has the maximum moment of axis which has the maximum moment of inertia meaning it requires the most inertia meaning it requires the most inertia meaning it requires the most torque to accelerate it in that torque to accelerate it in that torque to accelerate it in that direction spinning about the short axis direction spinning about the short axis direction spinning about the short axis has the least moment of inertia then has the least moment of inertia then has the least moment of inertia then there is the intermediate axis which has there is the intermediate axis which has there is the intermediate axis which has a moment of inertia in between the other a moment of inertia in between the other a moment of inertia in between the other two now the intermediate axis theorem two now the intermediate axis theorem two now the intermediate axis theorem says that if you try to flip any object says that if you try to flip any object says that if you try to flip any object along its intermediate axis it will not along its intermediate axis it will not along its intermediate axis it will not maintain simply that rot rotation it maintain simply that rot rotation it maintain simply that rot rotation it will also get rotations in any of the will also get rotations in any of the will also get rotations in any of the other directions that is if there is any other directions that is if there is any other directions that is if there is any slight deviation from a perfect rotation slight deviation from a perfect rotation slight deviation from a perfect rotation so why does this happen well the so why does this happen well the so why does this happen well the mathematics is kind of complicated but mathematics is kind of complicated but mathematics is kind of complicated but it's similar to the mathematics of a it's similar to the mathematics of a it's similar to the mathematics of a rigid pendulum so if you're flipping the rigid pendulum so if you're flipping the rigid pendulum so if you're flipping the phone along its long Axis or its short phone along its long Axis or its short phone along its long Axis or its short axis the phone acts a little bit like axis the phone acts a little bit like axis the phone acts a little bit like this pendulum in that any perturbation this pendulum in that any perturbation this pendulum in that any perturbation will cause it simply to go back to where will cause it simply to go back to where will cause it simply to go back to where it was before but if you're flipping it it was before but if you're flipping it it was before but if you're flipping it along its intermediate axis it's as along its intermediate axis it's as along its intermediate axis it's as though you're trying trying to balance though you're trying trying to balance though you're trying trying to balance the pendulum on its end in which case the pendulum on its end in which case the pendulum on its end in which case it's very unstable and any slight it's very unstable and any slight it's very unstable and any slight perturbation may cause it perturbation may cause it perturbation may cause it to exponentially increase so that is why to exponentially increase so that is why to exponentially increase so that is why you can't just flip your phone along its you can't just flip your phone along its you can't just flip your phone along its intermediate axis without it also intermediate axis without it also intermediate axis without it also spinning along one of the other axes I spinning along one of the other axes I spinning along one of the other axes I showed you that an electrically charged showed you that an electrically charged showed you that an electrically charged object can deflect a stream of water but object can deflect a stream of water but object can deflect a stream of water but it is not due to the common explanation it is not due to the common explanation it is not due to the common explanation the common reason which is given which the common reason which is given which the common reason which is given which is that water is a polar molecule is that water is a polar molecule is that water is a polar molecule so what really is causing this water to so what really is causing this water to so what really is causing this water to be attracted towards the cup well it is be attracted towards the cup well it is be attracted towards the cup well it is charges but it is ions it is dissolved charges but it is ions it is dissolved charges but it is ions it is dissolved ions in the water there will be some o ions in the water there will be some o ions in the water there will be some o ions some H+ ions and there'll also be ions some H+ ions and there'll also be ions some H+ ions and there'll also be some other impurity ions in the water so some other impurity ions in the water so some other impurity ions in the water so what happens when you hold this what happens when you hold this what happens when you hold this negatively charged cup up against the negatively charged cup up against the negatively charged cup up against the water stream is it will repel the water stream is it will repel the water stream is it will repel the negative charges the negative ions in negative charges the negative ions in negative charges the negative ions in the water some of which will go back up the water some of which will go back up the water some of which will go back up into the tap and that means the water into the tap and that means the water into the tap and that means the water coming down will be slightly positively coming down will be slightly positively coming down will be slightly positively charged and once it breaks up into charged and once it breaks up into charged and once it breaks up into droplets those droplets have a positive droplets those droplets have a positive droplets those droplets have a positive charge that they can't get rid of so now charge that they can't get rid of so now charge that they can't get rid of so now those positive droplets are attracted to those positive droplets are attracted to those positive droplets are attracted to the negatively charged cup and you can the negatively charged cup and you can the negatively charged cup and you can see those droplets swirling around the see those droplets swirling around the see those droplets swirling around the cup because they are so attracted to it cup because they are so attracted to it cup because they are so attracted to it so this is not actually a very good so this is not actually a very good so this is not actually a very good demonstration of the Polar nature of demonstration of the Polar nature of demonstration of the Polar nature of water even non-polar substances with water even non-polar substances with water even non-polar substances with some ions dissolved in them will deflect some ions dissolved in them will deflect some ions dissolved in them will deflect in exactly this way so this is actually in exactly this way so this is actually in exactly this way so this is actually showing us that water droplets are showing us that water droplets are showing us that water droplets are charged they are charged by induction charged they are charged by induction charged they are charged by induction and it is not due to the polar nature of and it is not due to the polar nature of and it is not due to the polar nature of water that they are attracted to water that they are attracted to water that they are attracted to electrically charged objects now you electrically charged objects now you electrically charged objects now you know in the teabag rocket we showed that know in the teabag rocket we showed that know in the teabag rocket we showed that if you light a teabag on fire from the if you light a teabag on fire from the if you light a teabag on fire from the top it will actually take off into the top it will actually take off into the top it will actually take off into the air that happens because as the tea bag air that happens because as the tea bag air that happens because as the tea bag is burning all the air inside it heats is burning all the air inside it heats is burning all the air inside it heats up and so it expands so it gets less up and so it expands so it gets less up and so it expands so it gets less dense and it's pushed up by all the dense and it's pushed up by all the dense and it's pushed up by all the cooler air around it you know sometimes cooler air around it you know sometimes cooler air around it you know sometimes people talk about about how hot air people talk about about how hot air people talk about about how hot air rises I mean that is what hot air does rises I mean that is what hot air does rises I mean that is what hot air does but only because the cooler air around but only because the cooler air around but only because the cooler air around it is pushing it up in essence it's like it is pushing it up in essence it's like it is pushing it up in essence it's like a buoyant force because the hot air is a buoyant force because the hot air is a buoyant force because the hot air is now less dense than the cooler air now less dense than the cooler air now less dense than the cooler air around it so when the teabag Burns right around it so when the teabag Burns right around it so when the teabag Burns right down to the bottom the remaining Ash is down to the bottom the remaining Ash is down to the bottom the remaining Ash is so light that it gets swept up in that so light that it gets swept up in that so light that it gets swept up in that convection current and you get a teabag rocket so do you agree with all of my rocket so do you agree with all of my rocket so do you agree with all of my explanations and did you get them right explanations and did you get them right explanations and did you get them right the first time let me know in the the first time let me know in the the first time let me know in the comments and thanks for watching
