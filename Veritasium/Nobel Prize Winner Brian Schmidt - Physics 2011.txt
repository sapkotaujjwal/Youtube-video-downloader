WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'm here at the mount Strow Observatory I'm here at the mount Strow Observatory I'm here at the mount Strow Observatory to talk to one of this year's Nobel to talk to one of this year's Nobel to talk to one of this year's Nobel Prize winners for physics Professor Prize winners for physics Professor Prize winners for physics Professor Brian Schmidt still feels kind of weird Brian Schmidt still feels kind of weird Brian Schmidt still feels kind of weird I don't know I don't really feel like a I don't know I don't really feel like a I don't know I don't really feel like a Nobel Prize when I go and say okay got Nobel Prize when I go and say okay got Nobel Prize when I go and say okay got Heisenberg got Heisenberg got Heisenberg got Einstein doesn't seem quite well that's Einstein doesn't seem quite well that's Einstein doesn't seem quite well that's an extraordinary honor so you know an extraordinary honor so you know an extraordinary honor so you know congratulations to you um so can you congratulations to you um so can you congratulations to you um so can you tell us why have you been awarded this tell us why have you been awarded this tell us why have you been awarded this prize so in 1998 uh Adam Reese was one prize so in 1998 uh Adam Reese was one prize so in 1998 uh Adam Reese was one of the other co-recipients and I uh of the other co-recipients and I uh of the other co-recipients and I uh working with the team of 18 other people working with the team of 18 other people working with the team of 18 other people discovered that the universal expansion discovered that the universal expansion discovered that the universal expansion the cosmic expansion of the universe was the cosmic expansion of the universe was the cosmic expansion of the universe was speeding up and that was the wrong speeding up and that was the wrong speeding up and that was the wrong direction we had expected gravity to direction we had expected gravity to direction we had expected gravity to cause the universe to slow down and so cause the universe to slow down and so cause the universe to slow down and so the fact that the Universe was speeding the fact that the Universe was speeding the fact that the Universe was speeding up meant that gravity was not working as up meant that gravity was not working as up meant that gravity was not working as we had expected and we think that's we had expected and we think that's we had expected and we think that's because about 73% of the universe is because about 73% of the universe is because about 73% of the universe is something we called Dark Energy something we called Dark Energy something we called Dark Energy something we didn't know existed before something we didn't know existed before something we didn't know existed before and that causes gravity to push rather and that causes gravity to push rather and that causes gravity to push rather than pull does it actually cause gravity than pull does it actually cause gravity than pull does it actually cause gravity to change to change to change well it means that we always think the well it means that we always think the well it means that we always think the gravity always pulls but according to gravity always pulls but according to gravity always pulls but according to Einstein the way gravity works really Einstein the way gravity works really Einstein the way gravity works really depends on on the material itself and depends on on the material itself and depends on on the material itself and energy tied to space gravity pushes it energy tied to space gravity pushes it energy tied to space gravity pushes it doesn't pull so do we have any sort of doesn't pull so do we have any sort of doesn't pull so do we have any sort of hints as to what this energy in space hints as to what this energy in space hints as to what this energy in space could be well Einstein said it might could be well Einstein said it might could be well Einstein said it might just be energy that's just there but it just be energy that's just there but it just be energy that's just there but it would be nice to have a better would be nice to have a better would be nice to have a better explanation than that and honestly no we explanation than that and honestly no we explanation than that and honestly no we do not have any hints of what it might do not have any hints of what it might do not have any hints of what it might be so why is this result so remarkable be so why is this result so remarkable be so why is this result so remarkable why are people so excited about it you why are people so excited about it you why are people so excited about it you know it's big when you discover 73% of know it's big when you discover 73% of know it's big when you discover 73% of everything there is you know that's everything there is you know that's everything there is you know that's that's overturning what we expected and that's overturning what we expected and that's overturning what we expected and it's weird it's not even normal stuff it's weird it's not even normal stuff it's weird it's not even normal stuff it's weird stuff and so you know I think it's weird stuff and so you know I think it's weird stuff and so you know I think it it it highlights either that we were it it it highlights either that we were it it it highlights either that we were just missing this huge part of the just missing this huge part of the just missing this huge part of the universe before or that somehow gravity universe before or that somehow gravity universe before or that somehow gravity and quantum mechanics which we know we and quantum mechanics which we know we and quantum mechanics which we know we don't have a theory for are playing don't have a theory for are playing don't have a theory for are playing tricks uh with physics in a way that we tricks uh with physics in a way that we tricks uh with physics in a way that we don't quite have sorted out and so I don't quite have sorted out and so I don't quite have sorted out and so I guess some of the hope is that maybe we guess some of the hope is that maybe we guess some of the hope is that maybe we can use these observations to probe the can use these observations to probe the can use these observations to probe the link between gravity and quantum link between gravity and quantum link between gravity and quantum mechanics and hopefully potentially sort mechanics and hopefully potentially sort mechanics and hopefully potentially sort that out have you heard about this study that out have you heard about this study that out have you heard about this study that says that Nobel Prize winners live that says that Nobel Prize winners live that says that Nobel Prize winners live a few years longer than similar a few years longer than similar a few years longer than similar scientists who are short listed for the scientists who are short listed for the scientists who are short listed for the prize but don't actually win wow I have prize but don't actually win wow I have prize but don't actually win wow I have not heard that uh how are you feeling not heard that uh how are you feeling not heard that uh how are you feeling are you feeling healthier now uh no are you feeling healthier now uh no are you feeling healthier now uh no actually I'm not feeling kind of feeling actually I'm not feeling kind of feeling actually I'm not feeling kind of feeling stressed so uh I we'll see maybe uh in stressed so uh I we'll see maybe uh in stressed so uh I we'll see maybe uh in the long term I think it it should pay the long term I think it it should pay the long term I think it it should pay off well I'm hoping it's because of good off well I'm hoping it's because of good off well I'm hoping it's because of good wine and things I get to drink of course wine and things I get to drink of course wine and things I get to drink of course all right well thank you so much for all right well thank you so much for all right well thank you so much for having a chat with me today yeah my having a chat with me today yeah my having a chat with me today yeah my pleasure appreciate it
