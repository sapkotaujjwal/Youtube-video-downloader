WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] inside each one of your cells there is inside each one of your cells there is inside each one of your cells there is six feet of DNA made up of six billion six feet of DNA made up of six billion six feet of DNA made up of six billion letters of genetic code now your DNA is letters of genetic code now your DNA is letters of genetic code now your DNA is split into 46 pieces each 3 to 4 cm long split into 46 pieces each 3 to 4 cm long split into 46 pieces each 3 to 4 cm long called chromosomes now normally we think called chromosomes now normally we think called chromosomes now normally we think of chromosomes as looking like this but of chromosomes as looking like this but of chromosomes as looking like this but they only take that form when a cell is they only take that form when a cell is they only take that form when a cell is ready to divide so usually DNA is just a ready to divide so usually DNA is just a ready to divide so usually DNA is just a wiggly thread within the nucleus now if wiggly thread within the nucleus now if wiggly thread within the nucleus now if you can imagine DNA is only about 2 you can imagine DNA is only about 2 you can imagine DNA is only about 2 nanom wide but a chromosome is cm long nanom wide but a chromosome is cm long nanom wide but a chromosome is cm long so you would think that it would get so you would think that it would get so you would think that it would get tangled worse than the headphones in tangled worse than the headphones in tangled worse than the headphones in your bag so the DNA is actually wrapped your bag so the DNA is actually wrapped your bag so the DNA is actually wrapped around proteins called histones now around proteins called histones now around proteins called histones now those histones have Wiggly Tails which those histones have Wiggly Tails which those histones have Wiggly Tails which will come in handy as we'll see in a will come in handy as we'll see in a will come in handy as we'll see in a moment your unique set of DNA first moment your unique set of DNA first moment your unique set of DNA first formed when 23 chromosomes from your mom formed when 23 chromosomes from your mom formed when 23 chromosomes from your mom mixed with 23 from your dad now 22 of mixed with 23 from your dad now 22 of mixed with 23 from your dad now 22 of those chromosomes from each parent form those chromosomes from each parent form those chromosomes from each parent form matching pairs but the 23rd set is the matching pairs but the 23rd set is the matching pairs but the 23rd set is the sex chromosomes so two X chromosomes sex chromosomes so two X chromosomes sex chromosomes so two X chromosomes make you female and an X and A Y make make you female and an X and A Y make make you female and an X and A Y make you male now since the male sex you male now since the male sex you male now since the male sex chromosomes are different both can chromosomes are different both can chromosomes are different both can remain active for the rest of your life remain active for the rest of your life remain active for the rest of your life but for females one of the X chromosomes but for females one of the X chromosomes but for females one of the X chromosomes needs to be inactivated in order for needs to be inactivated in order for needs to be inactivated in order for proper development to occur this happens proper development to occur this happens proper development to occur this happens when a female embryo is Just 4 days old when a female embryo is Just 4 days old when a female embryo is Just 4 days old and consists of only 100 cells right now and consists of only 100 cells right now and consists of only 100 cells right now in this cell the ex chromosome from Dad in this cell the ex chromosome from Dad in this cell the ex chromosome from Dad and the one from Mom are both active but and the one from Mom are both active but and the one from Mom are both active but through a tiny molecular battle one of through a tiny molecular battle one of through a tiny molecular battle one of the X chromosomes wins and remains the X chromosomes wins and remains the X chromosomes wins and remains active while the other is active while the other is active while the other is inactivated this is done by packing the inactivated this is done by packing the inactivated this is done by packing the DNA closer together and making DNA closer together and making DNA closer together and making modifications to those dangly histone modifications to those dangly histone modifications to those dangly histone tails that signal this inactivation new tails that signal this inactivation new tails that signal this inactivation new structural proteins are also added to structural proteins are also added to structural proteins are also added to bind everything closer together and bind everything closer together and bind everything closer together and finally methyl groups these tiny little finally methyl groups these tiny little finally methyl groups these tiny little molecular markers are added to the DNA molecular markers are added to the DNA molecular markers are added to the DNA to basically signal to the cell that to basically signal to the cell that to basically signal to the cell that this DNA shouldn't be red so all of this this DNA shouldn't be red so all of this this DNA shouldn't be red so all of this together makes the DNA very difficult to together makes the DNA very difficult to together makes the DNA very difficult to access for the molecular Machinery that access for the molecular Machinery that access for the molecular Machinery that would harness the code in this DNA it is would harness the code in this DNA it is would harness the code in this DNA it is Switched Off This DNA is silenced in Switched Off This DNA is silenced in Switched Off This DNA is silenced in contrast the active X chromosome DNA is contrast the active X chromosome DNA is contrast the active X chromosome DNA is more spread more spread more spread out this allows better access to the out this allows better access to the out this allows better access to the genes on the chromosome histones can be slid along chromosome histones can be slid along chromosome histones can be slid along the DNA or removed entirely and the histone Tails have a different and the histone Tails have a different and the histone Tails have a different modification signaling this DNA is modification signaling this DNA is modification signaling this DNA is active now all of this makes it possible active now all of this makes it possible active now all of this makes it possible for RNA polymerase to access and for RNA polymerase to access and for RNA polymerase to access and transcribe this DNA into messenger RNA transcribe this DNA into messenger RNA transcribe this DNA into messenger RNA which then goes out into the cell and is which then goes out into the cell and is which then goes out into the cell and is used to make a protein now what's used to make a protein now what's used to make a protein now what's surprising about X chromosome in surprising about X chromosome in surprising about X chromosome in activation is that it seems kind of activation is that it seems kind of activation is that it seems kind of random which X chromosome wins I mean in random which X chromosome wins I mean in random which X chromosome wins I mean in some cells dad's ex chromosome winds and some cells dad's ex chromosome winds and some cells dad's ex chromosome winds and in others mom's ex chromosome winds so in others mom's ex chromosome winds so in others mom's ex chromosome winds so this 100 cell embryo ends up with a this 100 cell embryo ends up with a this 100 cell embryo ends up with a mixture of active X chromosomes but from mixture of active X chromosomes but from mixture of active X chromosomes but from this point forward as these cells divide this point forward as these cells divide this point forward as these cells divide they maintain the active X chromosome they maintain the active X chromosome they maintain the active X chromosome that they had inside so all of the cells that they had inside so all of the cells that they had inside so all of the cells with dad's active X chromosome give rise with dad's active X chromosome give rise with dad's active X chromosome give rise to further cells with dad's active X to further cells with dad's active X to further cells with dad's active X chromosome and this continues on into chromosome and this continues on into chromosome and this continues on into adulthood so if you could look at a adulthood so if you could look at a adulthood so if you could look at a woman's skin and see which X chromosome woman's skin and see which X chromosome woman's skin and see which X chromosome has been inactivated you would see a has been inactivated you would see a has been inactivated you would see a stripy pattern which shows the growth stripy pattern which shows the growth stripy pattern which shows the growth and Mig and Mig and Mig of all of these first 100 cells when the of all of these first 100 cells when the of all of these first 100 cells when the embryo was just 4 days [Music] old now of course you can actually see old now of course you can actually see old now of course you can actually see that in humans but you can see this with that in humans but you can see this with that in humans but you can see this with Calico cats and that's because the gene Calico cats and that's because the gene Calico cats and that's because the gene for coat color is actually on the X for coat color is actually on the X for coat color is actually on the X chromosome so just by looking at the chromosome so just by looking at the chromosome so just by looking at the pattern of her spots here her dark and pattern of her spots here her dark and pattern of her spots here her dark and light spots you can see where her mom or light spots you can see where her mom or light spots you can see where her mom or dad's ex chromosome has been inactivated dad's ex chromosome has been inactivated dad's ex chromosome has been inactivated and this also shows us that only female and this also shows us that only female and this also shows us that only female cats can be calico cats and that's cats can be calico cats and that's cats can be calico cats and that's because well only female cats can because well only female cats can because well only female cats can inherit two X chromosomes with two inherit two X chromosomes with two inherit two X chromosomes with two different color different color different color genes now this is just one really cool genes now this is just one really cool genes now this is just one really cool example of epigenetics but epigenetics example of epigenetics but epigenetics example of epigenetics but epigenetics doesn't normally work on one whole doesn't normally work on one whole doesn't normally work on one whole chromosome in fact it's at play in all chromosome in fact it's at play in all chromosome in fact it's at play in all of your chromosomes turning on and off of your chromosomes turning on and off of your chromosomes turning on and off your genes for example it's epigenetics your genes for example it's epigenetics your genes for example it's epigenetics which makes a pancreatic cell capable of which makes a pancreatic cell capable of which makes a pancreatic cell capable of producing insulin because that Gene is producing insulin because that Gene is producing insulin because that Gene is switched on there but Switched Off switched on there but Switched Off switched on there but Switched Off everywhere else what's more interesting everywhere else what's more interesting everywhere else what's more interesting is that it seems the behaviors you take is that it seems the behaviors you take is that it seems the behaviors you take can actually affect your epigenetics and can actually affect your epigenetics and can actually affect your epigenetics and even weirder perhaps the things that even weirder perhaps the things that even weirder perhaps the things that your parents or grandparents did can your parents or grandparents did can your parents or grandparents did can affect your epigenetics now can affect affect your epigenetics now can affect affect your epigenetics now can affect your DNA so you are not just a product your DNA so you are not just a product your DNA so you are not just a product of your genetic code you're not just a of your genetic code you're not just a of your genetic code you're not just a product of your DNA you are also a product of your DNA you are also a product of your DNA you are also a product of your epigenetics and that is product of your epigenetics and that is product of your epigenetics and that is influenced by your behavior and the influenced by your behavior and the influenced by your behavior and the behavior of your ancestors [Music]
