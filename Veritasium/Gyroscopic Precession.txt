WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en hey everyone it's me Derek from the hey everyone it's me Derek from the hey everyone it's me Derek from the channel veritasium and I've been channel veritasium and I've been channel veritasium and I've been following this series by Destin on following this series by Destin on following this series by Destin on smarter every day about helicopters and smarter every day about helicopters and smarter every day about helicopters and gyroscopic procession is just one of gyroscopic procession is just one of gyroscopic procession is just one of those things that still blows my mind as those things that still blows my mind as those things that still blows my mind as it did Destin so I'm here at the it did Destin so I'm here at the it did Destin so I'm here at the University of Sydney my old stomping University of Sydney my old stomping University of Sydney my old stomping grounds I'm going to borrow some of grounds I'm going to borrow some of grounds I'm going to borrow some of their lecture Dem equipment to hopefully their lecture Dem equipment to hopefully their lecture Dem equipment to hopefully teach you a bit about how gyroscopic teach you a bit about how gyroscopic teach you a bit about how gyroscopic procession procession procession works the first thing I need to do is works the first thing I need to do is works the first thing I need to do is talk about vectors because a lot of talk about vectors because a lot of talk about vectors because a lot of things in physics are vectors that means things in physics are vectors that means things in physics are vectors that means they have Direction so an example would they have Direction so an example would they have Direction so an example would be momentum and force those are two be momentum and force those are two be momentum and force those are two examples of some pretty common vectors examples of some pretty common vectors examples of some pretty common vectors so if I have a cart moving along here it so if I have a cart moving along here it so if I have a cart moving along here it has some momentum in that direction and has some momentum in that direction and has some momentum in that direction and um if I apply a force to it I can change um if I apply a force to it I can change um if I apply a force to it I can change its momentum so for example if I push it its momentum so for example if I push it its momentum so for example if I push it to the right then its momentum will to the right then its momentum will to the right then its momentum will increase to the right it all makes a lot increase to the right it all makes a lot increase to the right it all makes a lot of sense well there's a similar of sense well there's a similar of sense well there's a similar statement we could make about rotating statement we could make about rotating statement we could make about rotating bodies which is that a torque increases bodies which is that a torque increases bodies which is that a torque increases the angular momentum of an object in the the angular momentum of an object in the the angular momentum of an object in the direction of that torque so let's try to direction of that torque so let's try to direction of that torque so let's try to figure out those terms if I apply a figure out those terms if I apply a figure out those terms if I apply a force down on this side of the wheel I force down on this side of the wheel I force down on this side of the wheel I create a torque now torque is force create a torque now torque is force create a torque now torque is force times the distance from the rotating times the distance from the rotating times the distance from the rotating axis you could call it R so torque is axis you could call it R so torque is axis you could call it R so torque is the force applied times the radius away the force applied times the radius away the force applied times the radius away from the Turning axis now what's the from the Turning axis now what's the from the Turning axis now what's the direction of that torque well we direction of that torque well we direction of that torque well we actually use a right- hand rule to actually use a right- hand rule to actually use a right- hand rule to Define this and so what you do is you Define this and so what you do is you Define this and so what you do is you put your fingers in the direction of the put your fingers in the direction of the put your fingers in the direction of the radius from the Turning axis radius from the Turning axis radius from the Turning axis and curl them in the direction of the and curl them in the direction of the and curl them in the direction of the force and your thumb points in the force and your thumb points in the force and your thumb points in the direction of the torque so the torque is direction of the torque so the torque is direction of the torque so the torque is actually out this way at 90° to the actually out this way at 90° to the actually out this way at 90° to the force the force is down that way but the force the force is down that way but the force the force is down that way but the torque Vector is actually pointing out torque Vector is actually pointing out torque Vector is actually pointing out this way so the angular momentum of this this way so the angular momentum of this this way so the angular momentum of this wheel is being increased in that wheel is being increased in that wheel is being increased in that direction so the more I apply this direction so the more I apply this direction so the more I apply this torque the more I increase the angular torque the more I increase the angular torque the more I increase the angular momentum of the wheel in the direction momentum of the wheel in the direction momentum of the wheel in the direction of the torque so I'm making this wheel of the torque so I'm making this wheel of the torque so I'm making this wheel have a very large angular momentum out have a very large angular momentum out have a very large angular momentum out towards the camera out towards you now towards the camera out towards you now towards the camera out towards you now before I go any further let's have a before I go any further let's have a before I go any further let's have a look at this setup that I've got I have look at this setup that I've got I have look at this setup that I've got I have a wheel here hanging from only one side a wheel here hanging from only one side a wheel here hanging from only one side by this rope and so right now there's by this rope and so right now there's by this rope and so right now there's actually a torque on the whole system if actually a torque on the whole system if actually a torque on the whole system if I let go because the weight of this I let go because the weight of this I let go because the weight of this wheel is pulling down and that force is wheel is pulling down and that force is wheel is pulling down and that force is applied at this distance away from its applied at this distance away from its applied at this distance away from its pivoting point there so if I let go well pivoting point there so if I let go well pivoting point there so if I let go well it does exactly what you'd expect the it does exactly what you'd expect the it does exactly what you'd expect the wheel uh swings down this way but I want wheel uh swings down this way but I want wheel uh swings down this way but I want to see that as an example of rotational to see that as an example of rotational to see that as an example of rotational motion there's a torque which is motion there's a torque which is motion there's a torque which is pointing out this way which is trying to pointing out this way which is trying to pointing out this way which is trying to increase the angular momentum of the increase the angular momentum of the increase the angular momentum of the system in that direction now angular system in that direction now angular system in that direction now angular momentum in that direction requires that momentum in that direction requires that momentum in that direction requires that the whole system starts swinging the whole system starts swinging the whole system starts swinging anticlockwise and so that is what anticlockwise and so that is what anticlockwise and so that is what happens but what happens if I only let happens but what happens if I only let happens but what happens if I only let go after I've already spun up the go after I've already spun up the go after I've already spun up the bicycle wheel well in that case the bicycle wheel well in that case the bicycle wheel well in that case the bicycle wheel would already have angular bicycle wheel would already have angular bicycle wheel would already have angular momentum this way and so a torque momentum this way and so a torque momentum this way and so a torque pushing that way actually swings this pushing that way actually swings this pushing that way actually swings this angular moment momentum round that way angular moment momentum round that way angular moment momentum round that way okay so let me try to get the wheel okay so let me try to get the wheel okay so let me try to get the wheel spinning and make it work come work come work come on look at that it's rotating as we on look at that it's rotating as we on look at that it's rotating as we predicted see the angular momentum predicted see the angular momentum predicted see the angular momentum Vector is pointing out this way but Vector is pointing out this way but Vector is pointing out this way but torque is pushing it this way so angular torque is pushing it this way so angular torque is pushing it this way so angular momentum torque and torque is pushing momentum torque and torque is pushing momentum torque and torque is pushing that angular momentum Vector around that angular momentum Vector around that angular momentum Vector around except not for long because this appears except not for long because this appears except not for long because this appears to be quite frictional friction full to be quite frictional friction full to be quite frictional friction full wheel so uh check out D's other videos wheel so uh check out D's other videos wheel so uh check out D's other videos about helicopter physics and then come about helicopter physics and then come about helicopter physics and then come check out my channel veritasium where check out my channel veritasium where check out my channel veritasium where you can find more like this except I you can find more like this except I you can find more like this except I don't often nearly get my head cut off don't often nearly get my head cut off don't often nearly get my head cut off by a bicycle wheel so
