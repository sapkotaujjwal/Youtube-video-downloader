WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now it's time for me to get something now it's time for me to get something now it's time for me to get something off my chest it's been bugging me since off my chest it's been bugging me since off my chest it's been bugging me since I was a little kid so you may as well be I was a little kid so you may as well be I was a little kid so you may as well be my first victims now all of you out my first victims now all of you out my first victims now all of you out there know what an atom looks like right there know what an atom looks like right there know what an atom looks like right it looks like this so am I right no I'm wrong that's this so am I right no I'm wrong that's this so am I right no I'm wrong that's called the boss sommerfeld atam that's called the boss sommerfeld atam that's called the boss sommerfeld atam that's what an atam looked like back in the what an atam looked like back in the what an atam looked like back in the 1920s and ever since the introduction of 1920s and ever since the introduction of 1920s and ever since the introduction of quantum mechanics towards the end of the quantum mechanics towards the end of the quantum mechanics towards the end of the 20s that's been obsolete it's 90 years 20s that's been obsolete it's 90 years 20s that's been obsolete it's 90 years old it's ancient and yet people still old it's ancient and yet people still old it's ancient and yet people still think of this as the the picture of the think of this as the the picture of the think of this as the the picture of the atom I prefer to think of this as the atom I prefer to think of this as the atom I prefer to think of this as the hula hoop atom now the thing that really bugs me atom now the thing that really bugs me atom now the thing that really bugs me is that corporations and even some is that corporations and even some is that corporations and even some research institutions when they want to research institutions when they want to research institutions when they want to convince you that they're at The Cutting convince you that they're at The Cutting convince you that they're at The Cutting Edge they go and stick a couple of these Edge they go and stick a couple of these Edge they go and stick a couple of these hula hoop atoms in their corporate hula hoop atoms in their corporate hula hoop atoms in their corporate logo it would be like apple advertising logo it would be like apple advertising logo it would be like apple advertising their their iPhone by showing you a their their iPhone by showing you a their their iPhone by showing you a Candlestick telephone it's crazy what's Candlestick telephone it's crazy what's Candlestick telephone it's crazy what's a better way of representing the atom a better way of representing the atom a better way of representing the atom instead of these hula hoop orbits you instead of these hula hoop orbits you instead of these hula hoop orbits you should think of the electrons as buzzing should think of the electrons as buzzing should think of the electrons as buzzing around the nucleus in a fuzzy little around the nucleus in a fuzzy little around the nucleus in a fuzzy little Cloud an electron cloud have a look at Cloud an electron cloud have a look at Cloud an electron cloud have a look at this so imagine we have this fuzzy this so imagine we have this fuzzy this so imagine we have this fuzzy spherical thing a bit like that we can spherical thing a bit like that we can spherical thing a bit like that we can chop it up into a whole bunch of pieces chop it up into a whole bunch of pieces chop it up into a whole bunch of pieces we can chop it up into spherical bits we can chop it up into spherical bits we can chop it up into spherical bits called s orbitals these more comp at called s orbitals these more comp at called s orbitals these more comp at things called P orbitals and these ring things called P orbitals and these ring things called P orbitals and these ring like these things that look like like these things that look like like these things that look like calamari that we call D calamari that we call D calamari that we call D orbitals so what are these orbitals mean orbitals so what are these orbitals mean orbitals so what are these orbitals mean basically that fuzziness tells you the basically that fuzziness tells you the basically that fuzziness tells you the probability that there's an electron probability that there's an electron probability that there's an electron there because quantum mechanics says at there because quantum mechanics says at there because quantum mechanics says at any given moment we can't tell you any given moment we can't tell you any given moment we can't tell you exactly where an electron's going to be exactly where an electron's going to be exactly where an electron's going to be and what speed it's going all we can do and what speed it's going all we can do and what speed it's going all we can do is calculate the probability is going to is calculate the probability is going to is calculate the probability is going to be in some point the probability has a be in some point the probability has a be in some point the probability has a certain speed and so on and those certain speed and so on and those certain speed and so on and those electron clouds represent that fuzzy electron clouds represent that fuzzy electron clouds represent that fuzzy probability that's not the only way that probability that's not the only way that probability that's not the only way that you can chop up the electron Cloud what you can chop up the electron Cloud what you can chop up the electron Cloud what I showed you was typically the way that I showed you was typically the way that I showed you was typically the way that physicists do it chemists mathematically physicists do it chemists mathematically physicists do it chemists mathematically chop up their electron clouds using a chop up their electron clouds using a chop up their electron clouds using a different set of orbitals this is an S different set of orbitals this is an S different set of orbitals this is an S orbital spherical thing this is a p orbital spherical thing this is a p orbital spherical thing this is a p orbital a dumbbell shaped orbital you orbital a dumbbell shaped orbital you orbital a dumbbell shaped orbital you have pointing in all sorts of directions have pointing in all sorts of directions have pointing in all sorts of directions and here's a couple of examples of D and here's a couple of examples of D and here's a couple of examples of D orbitals so my advice to the marketing orbitals so my advice to the marketing orbitals so my advice to the marketing department of some great corporation department of some great corporation department of some great corporation that wants to show you how Cutting Edge that wants to show you how Cutting Edge that wants to show you how Cutting Edge they are is that instead of using hula they are is that instead of using hula they are is that instead of using hula hoop atoms they should include balloon hoop atoms they should include balloon hoop atoms they should include balloon animals in their corporate animals in their corporate animals in their corporate logos and I thank you for [Music] [Music] [Music] listening hey
