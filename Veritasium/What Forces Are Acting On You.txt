WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en what are the forces acting on you right what are the forces acting on you right what are the forces acting on you right now I want to answer this question by now I want to answer this question by now I want to answer this question by introducing something called a free body introducing something called a free body introducing something called a free body diagram this is a sketch that scientists diagram this is a sketch that scientists diagram this is a sketch that scientists make that shows all the forces acting on make that shows all the forces acting on make that shows all the forces acting on an object each force is represented by an object each force is represented by an object each force is represented by an arrow the size of the arrow an arrow the size of the arrow an arrow the size of the arrow represents the magnitude of the force represents the magnitude of the force represents the magnitude of the force and its direction indicates the and its direction indicates the and its direction indicates the direction of the force so for example direction of the force so for example direction of the force so for example right now there is a Down W right now there is a Down W right now there is a Down W gravitational force on me that pulls me gravitational force on me that pulls me gravitational force on me that pulls me towards the center of the earth there's towards the center of the earth there's towards the center of the earth there's another force that a lot of people don't another force that a lot of people don't another force that a lot of people don't think about but is pretty important and think about but is pretty important and think about but is pretty important and it's the force from the ground pushing it's the force from the ground pushing it's the force from the ground pushing me me me upward for most people it's kind of upward for most people it's kind of upward for most people it's kind of strange to think that the ground which strange to think that the ground which strange to think that the ground which is something inanimate could be putting is something inanimate could be putting is something inanimate could be putting a force up on me but let me try to a force up on me but let me try to a force up on me but let me try to convince you that the Earth really is convince you that the Earth really is convince you that the Earth really is pushing up on me by uh stepping on this pushing up on me by uh stepping on this pushing up on me by uh stepping on this toy here that supported by a toy here that supported by a toy here that supported by a spring as I step onto the spring it spring as I step onto the spring it spring as I step onto the spring it contracts so you can imagine the spring contracts so you can imagine the spring contracts so you can imagine the spring must be trying to expand out and put a must be trying to expand out and put a must be trying to expand out and put a force force force outwards so that force in effect outwards so that force in effect outwards so that force in effect supports me pushes up on my feet and supports me pushes up on my feet and supports me pushes up on my feet and balances the gravitational force down so balances the gravitational force down so balances the gravitational force down so that I remain that I remain that I remain motionless now the ground is very motionless now the ground is very motionless now the ground is very similar to this spring the ground is similar to this spring the ground is similar to this spring the ground is just a very stiff spring but every time just a very stiff spring but every time just a very stiff spring but every time you step you compress the ground a you step you compress the ground a you step you compress the ground a little bit and that is enough to make little bit and that is enough to make little bit and that is enough to make the ground create a force on you pushing the ground create a force on you pushing the ground create a force on you pushing you back up and the force of the ground you back up and the force of the ground you back up and the force of the ground upwards must be equal to the upwards must be equal to the upwards must be equal to the gravitational force downwards so that gravitational force downwards so that gravitational force downwards so that you stay at rest for Simplicity we draw you stay at rest for Simplicity we draw you stay at rest for Simplicity we draw all forces acting through the center of all forces acting through the center of all forces acting through the center of mass of an object so even though the mass of an object so even though the mass of an object so even though the force is acting on my feet I can draw force is acting on my feet I can draw force is acting on my feet I can draw that Force upwards as acting through that Force upwards as acting through that Force upwards as acting through Myer Center of mass so there are really Myer Center of mass so there are really Myer Center of mass so there are really only two main forces on you the force of only two main forces on you the force of only two main forces on you the force of gravity downwards and something we call gravity downwards and something we call gravity downwards and something we call the normal force which pushes you back the normal force which pushes you back the normal force which pushes you back up the reason we call it the normal up the reason we call it the normal up the reason we call it the normal force is because the word normal means force is because the word normal means force is because the word normal means perpendicular and the force is perpendicular and the force is perpendicular and the force is perpendicular to the surface that you're perpendicular to the surface that you're perpendicular to the surface that you're standing on
