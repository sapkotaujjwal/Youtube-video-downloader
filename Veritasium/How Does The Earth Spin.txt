WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Music] If I uh apply a force to the globe, I If I uh apply a force to the globe, I If I uh apply a force to the globe, I can actually get it spinning can actually get it spinning can actually get it spinning in roughly the same way that the Earth in roughly the same way that the Earth in roughly the same way that the Earth spins. But it is it is tricky. There's spins. But it is it is tricky. There's spins. But it is it is tricky. There's very little friction on the bottom very little friction on the bottom very little friction on the bottom because of it being supported on this because of it being supported on this because of it being supported on this thin layer of water. And you can see the thin layer of water. And you can see the thin layer of water. And you can see the more force I apply to it, the more it more force I apply to it, the more it more force I apply to it, the more it accelerates. accelerates. accelerates. Oo. So, we're getting it speeding up Oo. So, we're getting it speeding up Oo. So, we're getting it speeding up here. here. here. When you when you push that, like it's When you when you push that, like it's When you when you push that, like it's not too easy to to get it going. Why is not too easy to to get it going. Why is not too easy to to get it going. Why is that? that? that? Friction. Probably Friction. Probably Friction. Probably so strangy. so strangy. so strangy. Why is it not really easy to push? What Why is it not really easy to push? What Why is it not really easy to push? What is it about this giant spear that makes is it about this giant spear that makes is it about this giant spear that makes it a challenge to push? it a challenge to push? it a challenge to push? The weight. The weight. The weight. The resistance. The resistance. The resistance. Gravity. Gravity. Gravity. Gravity. Gravity. Gravity. It's really heavy, too. So, I'm pretty It's really heavy, too. So, I'm pretty It's really heavy, too. So, I'm pretty sure the weight of it sitting down is sure the weight of it sitting down is sure the weight of it sitting down is making it tough, too. making it tough, too. making it tough, too. You don't think its weight is supported You don't think its weight is supported You don't think its weight is supported by that water? by that water? by that water? Well, I know it's supported, but even Well, I know it's supported, but even Well, I know it's supported, but even though it's supported down, moving it, though it's supported down, moving it, though it's supported down, moving it, it's still like if it center of gravity it's still like if it center of gravity it's still like if it center of gravity is here, we still have to push the is here, we still have to push the is here, we still have to push the weight coming out from here. So, it's weight coming out from here. So, it's weight coming out from here. So, it's pretty heavy. I'm pretty sure. pretty heavy. I'm pretty sure. pretty heavy. I'm pretty sure. Most people will say if you just apply a Most people will say if you just apply a Most people will say if you just apply a force to it, it starts moving. force to it, it starts moving. force to it, it starts moving. That's not really the point I want to That's not really the point I want to That's not really the point I want to make. The point I want to make is the make. The point I want to make is the make. The point I want to make is the more force you apply to it, the more it more force you apply to it, the more it more force you apply to it, the more it speeds up, more gets going faster and speeds up, more gets going faster and speeds up, more gets going faster and faster and faster. But it's got 2 and 12 faster and faster. But it's got 2 and 12 faster and faster. But it's got 2 and 12 tons of inertia. So you can really feel tons of inertia. So you can really feel tons of inertia. So you can really feel that you have to push hard to accelerate that you have to push hard to accelerate that you have to push hard to accelerate it. What do you feel when you push on it. What do you feel when you push on it. What do you feel when you push on it? it? it? Just moves. When you push something, it Just moves. When you push something, it Just moves. When you push something, it moves. moves. moves. Does it do something more than move? Does it do something more than move? Does it do something more than move? Spinning. It's rotation, velocity, Spinning. It's rotation, velocity, Spinning. It's rotation, velocity, speed. There's some word you're looking speed. There's some word you're looking speed. There's some word you're looking for. for. for. There is a word I'm looking for. What do There is a word I'm looking for. What do There is a word I'm looking for. What do you feel? Is that hard? you feel? Is that hard? you feel? Is that hard? Uh, not really. Uh, not really. Uh, not really. It's easy. It's not going very fast, It's easy. It's not going very fast, It's easy. It's not going very fast, though. though. though. It's not like hard to push, but it's It's not like hard to push, but it's It's not like hard to push, but it's sort of hard to get going fast. sort of hard to get going fast. sort of hard to get going fast. It's too big to make it fast. It's too big to make it fast. It's too big to make it fast. Is it hard to make it fast? Is it hard to make it fast? Is it hard to make it fast? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why is it hard to make it fast? Can we Why is it hard to make it fast? Can we Why is it hard to make it fast? Can we try? try? try? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's try it. Let's get it going really Let's try it. Let's get it going really Let's try it. Let's get it going really fast. Yeah. How is that? Rotating. Spinning. Rotating. Spinning. Rotating. Spinning. So close. So close. So close. Moving. Moving. Moving. How do you make it go faster? How do you make it go faster? How do you make it go faster? Um, you only need to push hard hard and Um, you only need to push hard hard and Um, you only need to push hard hard and more harder than that. more harder than that. more harder than that. You put a force on an object, a net You put a force on an object, a net You put a force on an object, a net force, an unbalanced force, and it force, an unbalanced force, and it force, an unbalanced force, and it it it it come on goes. come on goes. come on goes. the least scientific. Whatever. It goes. the least scientific. Whatever. It goes. the least scientific. Whatever. It goes. You study physics, right? You study physics, right? You study physics, right? Yeah. Which means I'm probably looking a Yeah. Which means I'm probably looking a Yeah. Which means I'm probably looking a little bit like a here at all. little bit like a here at all. little bit like a here at all. It's easy to push, but like if you try It's easy to push, but like if you try It's easy to push, but like if you try to go fast, then it just sort of stays to go fast, then it just sort of stays to go fast, then it just sort of stays the same speed. But could you bring it to a stop? But could you bring it to a stop? But could you bring it to a stop? Probably not. Definitely not. Probably not. Definitely not. Probably not. Definitely not. Can you give it a shot? Can you give it a shot? Can you give it a shot? Stop the water. Stop the water. Stop the water. Well, other than cheating. Yeah. Well, other than cheating. Yeah. Well, other than cheating. Yeah. What do you think? Not going to happen. What do you think? Not going to happen. What do you think? Not going to happen. Really? Come on. Come on. Come on. Put Really? Come on. Come on. Come on. Put Really? Come on. Come on. Come on. Put your back into it. You can do it. your back into it. You can do it. your back into it. You can do it. I don't think it's going to work, but we I don't think it's going to work, but we I don't think it's going to work, but we can give it a shot. Kind of. Kind of. Kind of. What do you see there? What do you see there? What do you see there? It's stopped, but I It's only stopped It's stopped, but I It's only stopped It's stopped, but I It's only stopped cuz it's on like a very soft thing of cuz it's on like a very soft thing of cuz it's on like a very soft thing of water pretty much. I'm pretty sure. water pretty much. I'm pretty sure. water pretty much. I'm pretty sure. So, do you It's not going to stay So, do you It's not going to stay So, do you It's not going to stay stopped or what? It shouldn't. stopped or what? It shouldn't. stopped or what? It shouldn't. [Music] Huh. All right. Huh. All right. Huh. All right. Are you applying a force to this uh Are you applying a force to this uh Are you applying a force to this uh sphere here? sphere here? sphere here? Yes. Yes. Yes. What happens when you apply a force to What happens when you apply a force to What happens when you apply a force to the sphere? the sphere? the sphere? Then it changes like speed. Then it changes like speed. Then it changes like speed. That's a pretty awesome observation That's a pretty awesome observation That's a pretty awesome observation you've just made. you've just made. you've just made. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know that? Do you know that? Do you know that? I guess. I guess. I guess. So, we could generalize. We could say So, we could generalize. We could say So, we could generalize. We could say force causes change speed. change speed. change speed. Man, you are nailing this. Can you give Man, you are nailing this. Can you give Man, you are nailing this. Can you give me a high five? Boom. me a high five? Boom. me a high five? Boom. What do you think physics is? What do you think physics is? What do you think physics is? Um, like how things work, I guess. Um, like how things work, I guess. Um, like how things work, I guess. And you want to know how things work? And you want to know how things work? And you want to know how things work? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How old are you? How old are you? How old are you? 11. 11. 11. You seem pretty smart for being 11. You seem pretty smart for being 11. You seem pretty smart for being 11. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do people tell you that you're smart? Do people tell you that you're smart? Do people tell you that you're smart? No. No. No. Do you think you're smart? Do you think you're smart? Do you think you're smart? No. No. No. I think you're smart. I think you're smart. I think you're smart. Okay. Okay. Okay. You take my word for it. You take my word for it. You take my word for it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Really?
