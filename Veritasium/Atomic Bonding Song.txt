WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en In my outer electron shell Lies an electron all by itself I seek elation Through oxidation I have always felt incomplete One electron shy of eighteen I’ve the highest Electron affinity If we exchange this one electron We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration And we’ll release energy As ions you’ll see A bond Made by metals and non-metals I’m positive I’m negative A force of attraction creates this bond Made by metals and non-metals Ionic bonds Covalent bonds Metallic, these are the bonds of chemistry The octet rule says atoms like eight Electrons in their outermost state. I’ll share mine with you I’ll share with you If we both share these six electrons We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration And we’ll release energy Covalent there’ll be A Bond Electronegativity Is similar for non-metals And so,we share this bond of electrons Electronegativity Ionic Bonds Covalent Bonds Metallic,these are the bonds of chemistry Free Electrons all around Mutual attractive forces abound In this way I will stay Crystalline with you Our Bond Ionic bonds Covalent bonds Metallic 00:03:52,00:03:02 These are the bonds of chemistry
