WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en why do we get the seasons the seasons why do we get the seasons the seasons why do we get the seasons the seasons because of the atmosphere to be honest because of the atmosphere to be honest because of the atmosphere to be honest with you that's a very easy question to with you that's a very easy question to with you that's a very easy question to answer now we really don't get Seasons answer now we really don't get Seasons answer now we really don't get Seasons anymore because of global warming um I anymore because of global warming um I anymore because of global warming um I think there was a time when I was a think there was a time when I was a think there was a time when I was a child where we definitely had four child where we definitely had four child where we definitely had four seasons I think now we get summer summer seasons I think now we get summer summer seasons I think now we get summer summer summer and a little bit of winter in summer and a little bit of winter in summer and a little bit of winter in Australia is it to do with um the Australia is it to do with um the Australia is it to do with um the Earth's turning and the Earth's turning and the Earth's turning and the equator Four Seasons what the you mean equator Four Seasons what the you mean equator Four Seasons what the you mean like summer and winter and doesn't it come from where we are around doesn't it come from where we are around doesn't it come from where we are around the sun and at that stage that's the the sun and at that stage that's the the sun and at that stage that's the season that we're in I think the season that we're in I think the season that we're in I think the position of the earth uh depending on position of the earth uh depending on position of the earth uh depending on the sun it's like if the Earth is the sun it's like if the Earth is the sun it's like if the Earth is standing other positions to the Earth standing other positions to the Earth standing other positions to the Earth and there is winter summer and in the and there is winter summer and in the and there is winter summer and in the between there's uh Autumn and what is it between there's uh Autumn and what is it between there's uh Autumn and what is it spring cuz the Earth rotates on an axis spring cuz the Earth rotates on an axis spring cuz the Earth rotates on an axis right and I think so it goes around on right and I think so it goes around on right and I think so it goes around on an axis is well obviously the Earth an axis is well obviously the Earth an axis is well obviously the Earth isn't like spinning like like that it's isn't like spinning like like that it's isn't like spinning like like that it's sort of like on an angle cuz of the axis sort of like on an angle cuz of the axis sort of like on an angle cuz of the axis of the earth rotating the Earth rotating of the earth rotating the Earth rotating of the earth rotating the Earth rotating around its axis yeah what does the axis around its axis yeah what does the axis around its axis yeah what does the axis do uh it sends you further and closer to do uh it sends you further and closer to do uh it sends you further and closer to the Sun for example now the southern the Sun for example now the southern the Sun for example now the southern part Australian is winter now and Europe part Australian is winter now and Europe part Australian is winter now and Europe is in the summer season and then the is in the summer season and then the is in the summer season and then the north side of the um Earth is standing north side of the um Earth is standing north side of the um Earth is standing more close to the to the Sun and the more close to the to the Sun and the more close to the to the Sun and the south side is like far away from that south side is like far away from that south side is like far away from that it's cuz the Earth is at a I think it's it's cuz the Earth is at a I think it's it's cuz the Earth is at a I think it's a 22° tilt or something like that so as a 22° tilt or something like that so as a 22° tilt or something like that so as it goes around the Sun um that means it goes around the Sun um that means it goes around the Sun um that means that either the North or the southern that either the North or the southern that either the North or the southern hemisphere is close to the Sun so that hemisphere is close to the Sun so that hemisphere is close to the Sun so that um things are hotter or colder when when um things are hotter or colder when when um things are hotter or colder when when the earth go around the sun it's not a the earth go around the sun it's not a the earth go around the sun it's not a circle it's an ellipse so we have circle it's an ellipse so we have circle it's an ellipse so we have different distance to the to the Sun so different distance to the to the Sun so different distance to the to the Sun so therefore the further the sun is way the therefore the further the sun is way the therefore the further the sun is way the colder it is H in a country like it's colder it is H in a country like it's colder it is H in a country like it's cuz it's like an overall it's not like cuz it's like an overall it's not like cuz it's like an overall it's not like perfectly CLE it's like so the Sun comes perfectly CLE it's like so the Sun comes perfectly CLE it's like so the Sun comes closer this way and out further closer closer this way and out further closer closer this way and out further closer the uh elliptical pattern of the earth the uh elliptical pattern of the earth the uh elliptical pattern of the earth and the distance from closer to the Sun and the distance from closer to the Sun and the distance from closer to the Sun in summer and fur the furthest away from in summer and fur the furthest away from in summer and fur the furthest away from it in the winter sometimes the sun is actually winter sometimes the sun is actually winter sometimes the sun is actually glancing the surface of the Earth in glancing the surface of the Earth in glancing the surface of the Earth in certain regions and other times it's certain regions and other times it's certain regions and other times it's Square on like perpendicular well Square on like perpendicular well Square on like perpendicular well basically the sun's rays are more basically the sun's rays are more basically the sun's rays are more oblique at certain times of the year oblique at certain times of the year oblique at certain times of the year than others I think it's because of how than others I think it's because of how than others I think it's because of how the the sun rays are like hitting when the the sun rays are like hitting when the the sun rays are like hitting when they hit at an angle it doesn't get that they hit at an angle it doesn't get that they hit at an angle it doesn't get that hot
