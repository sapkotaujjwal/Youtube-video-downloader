WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en this is me at the end of college so this is me at the end of college so this is me at the end of college so anyway so today I'm packing up my room anyway so today I'm packing up my room anyway so today I'm packing up my room is absolutely disgusting uh there's dust is absolutely disgusting uh there's dust is absolutely disgusting uh there's dust all over the place unbelievable how much all over the place unbelievable how much all over the place unbelievable how much dust this place accumulates just unreal dust this place accumulates just unreal dust this place accumulates just unreal 21 year old me was apparently fascinated 21 year old me was apparently fascinated 21 year old me was apparently fascinated by dust but where does it all come from by dust but where does it all come from by dust but where does it all come from well in this video we are going to get well in this video we are going to get well in this video we are going to get to the bottom of this now this video was to the bottom of this now this video was to the bottom of this now this video was sponsored by Google and when they sponsored by Google and when they sponsored by Google and when they approached me about sponsoring a video I approached me about sponsoring a video I approached me about sponsoring a video I suggested I show you how I use Google to suggested I show you how I use Google to suggested I show you how I use Google to research a complex question after all research a complex question after all research a complex question after all research is just research anyway I research is just research anyway I research is just research anyway I couldn't pick a simple question like how couldn't pick a simple question like how couldn't pick a simple

a different video a PhD was filming a different video a PhD scientist told me you know 70 of scientist told me you know 70 of scientist told me you know 70 of household dust is dead skin and I'd household dust is dead skin and I'd household dust is dead skin and I'd heard that before and chances are you heard that before and chances are you heard that before and chances are you have two if

exactly the sort of thing dead skin it's exactly the sort of thing dead skin it's exactly the sort of thing that is gross enough to spread as an that is gross enough to spread as an that is gross enough to spread as an urban legend but it just seems urban legend but it just seems urban legend but it just seems implausible I mean if most dust is dead implausible I mean if most dust is dead implausible I mean if most dust is dead skin then why do abandoned buildings get skin then why do abandoned buildings get skin then why do abandoned buildings get dusty over time the debunking claims fit dusty over time the debunking claims fit dusty over time the debunking claims fit my preconceptions so it would be easy to my preconceptions so it would be easy to my preconceptions so it would be

totally dust is dead skin if that's totally wrong then how did the myth get started wrong then how did the myth get started wrong then how did the myth get started in the first place surely some dust must in the first place surely some dust must in the first place surely some dust must be dead skin but how much well the good be dead skin but how much well the good be dead skin but how much well the good strategy is to start broad how do you strategy is to start broad how do you strategy is to start broad how do you define dust exactly well dust is define dust exactly well dust is define dust exactly well dust is generally defined as particles that can generally defined as particles that can generally defined as particles that can become airborne for a significant period become airborne for a significant period become airborne for a significant period of time when perturbed by natural forces of time when perturbed by natural forces of time when perturbed by natural forces but how long is a significant period of but how long is a significant period of but how long is a significant period of time and what are natural forces exactly time and what are natural forces exactly time and what are natural forces exactly so the definition of dust has fuzzy so the definition of dust has fuzzy so the definition of dust has fuzzy boundaries kind of like dust itself boundaries kind of like dust itself boundaries kind of like dust itself if you ask the question how big is a if you ask the question how big is a if you ask the question how big is a dust particle you get different answers dust particle you get different answers dust particle you get different answers the international standardization the international standardization the international standardization organization defines dust as any organization defines dust as any organization defines dust as any particle smaller than 75 micrometers in particle smaller than 75 micrometers in particle smaller than 75 micrometers in diameter that's roughly the width of a diameter that's roughly the width of a diameter that's roughly the width of a human hair the glossary of atmospheric human hair the glossary of atmospheric human hair the glossary of atmospheric chemistry terms includes anything up to chemistry terms includes anything up to chemistry terms includes anything up to 100 micrometers but I've found several 100 micrometers but I've found several 100 micrometers but I've found several papers that include particles as large papers that include particles as large papers that include particles as large as two millimeters this large as two millimeters this large as two millimeters this large discrepancy is due to the fact the most discrepancy is due to the fact the most discrepancy is due to the fact the most important property of a dust particle is important property of a dust particle is important property of a dust particle is not its size but its settling velocity not its size but its settling velocity not its size but its settling velocity which then determines how long it can which then determines how long it can which then determines how long it can stay airborne a 100 micrometer metal stay airborne a 100 micrometer metal stay airborne a 100 micrometer metal ball would fall to the ground very ball would fall to the ground very ball would fall to the ground very quickly while a two millimeter long quickly while a two millimeter long quickly while a two millimeter long cotton fiber could float on indoor air cotton fiber could float on indoor air cotton fiber could float on indoor air currents indefinitely so to get around currents indefinitely so to get around currents indefinitely so to get around the different sizes shapes and densities the different

single human buy any of these metrics a single human skin cell with an average diameter of skin cell with an average diameter of skin cell with an average diameter of around 30 micrometers would count as around 30 micrometers would count as around 30 micrometers would count as dust so then how many dead skin cells dust so then how many dead skin cells dust so then how many dead skin cells are we shedding you'd think the average are we shedding you'd think the average are we shedding you'd think the average rate of skin shedding would be well rate of skin shedding would be well rate of skin shedding would be well established but the internet is a established but the internet is a established but the internet is a tangled web of misquotations and missing tangled web of misquotations and missing tangled web of misquotations and missing citations when it comes to skin in citations when it comes to skin in citations when it comes to skin in trying to answer this question I found trying to answer this question I found trying to answer this question I found dozens of web articles saying we shed dozens of web articles saying we shed dozens of web articles saying we shed anywhere between 30 000 skin cells per anywhere between 30 000 skin cells per anywhere between 30 000 skin cells per day to 300 000 skin cells per minute and day to 300 000 skin cells per minute and day to 300

for searching published scientific for searching published scientific research I was able to track down research I was able to track down research I was able to track down several peer-reviewed sources that several peer-reviewed sources that several peer-reviewed sources that agreed on the numbers agreed on the numbers agreed on the numbers every hour you create about 20 million every hour you create about 20 million every hour you create about 20 million new skin cells as those new skin cells new skin cells as those new skin cells new skin cells as those new skin cells form they push older cells up through form they push older cells up through form they push older cells up through the layers of the epidermis and over a the layers of the epidermis and over a the layers of the epidermis and over a period of weeks they flatten out and period of weeks they flatten out and period of weeks they flatten out and Harden forming the barrier that protects Harden forming the barrier that protects Harden forming the barrier that protects our bodies from the outside world our bodies from the outside world our bodies from the outside world ultimately these dead skin cells fall ultimately these dead skin cells fall ultimately these dead skin cells fall off usually one by one for healthy skin off usually one by one for healthy skin off usually one by one for healthy skin so we are constantly molting like a so we are constantly molting like a so we are constantly molting like a snake we just don't notice it because snake we just don't notice it because snake we just don't notice it because our skin comes off one cell at a time our skin comes off one cell at a time our skin comes off one cell at a time fun fact dead skin cells are shed more fun fact dead skin cells are shed more fun fact dead skin cells are shed more rapidly from your forearms than from rapidly from your forearms than from rapidly from your forearms than from your back and more rapidly from your your back and more rapidly from your your back and more rapidly from your back than from your abdomen and one of back than from your abdomen and one of back than from your abdomen and one of the ways scientists have measured these the ways scientists have measured these the ways scientists have measured these rates of skin shedding is actually by rates of skin shedding is actually by rates of skin shedding is actually by taping containers onto people's skin and collecting up the dead skin cells and collecting up the dead skin cells and collecting up the dead skin cells shed over at least a 48 hour period shed over at least a 48 hour period shed over at least a 48 hour period yeah I'm gonna regret this yeah I'm gonna regret this yeah I'm gonna regret this based on these measurements we know that based on these measurements we know that based on these measurements we know that each Square centimeter of your body is each Square centimeter of your body is each Square centimeter of your body is shedding around a thousand dead skin shedding around a thousand dead skin shedding around a thousand dead skin cells per hour cells per hour cells per hour now the average adult body has a surface now the average adult body has a surface now the average adult body has a surface area of nearly two square meters meaning area of nearly two square meters meaning area of nearly two square meters meaning you are shedding nearly 20 million dead you are shedding nearly 20 million dead you are shedding nearly 20 million dead skin cells per hour that adds up to half skin cells per hour that adds up to half skin cells per hour that adds up to half a billion dead skin cells per day now a billion dead skin cells per day now a billion dead skin cells per day now half a billion dead skin cells weigh half a billion dead skin cells weigh half a billion dead skin cells weigh between one and two grams that's just a between one and two grams that's just a between one and two grams that's just a little bit less than the weight of a little bit less than the weight of a little bit less than the weight of a penny penny penny over a year that means you should half a over a year that means you should half a over a year that means you should half a kilogram or over a pound of dead skin kilogram or over a pound of dead skin kilogram or over a pound of dead skin if you want to think about it another if you want to think about it another if you want to think about it another way in a single year you give off around way in a single year you give off around way in a single year you give off around 180 billion dead skin cells that's 180 billion dead skin cells that's 180 billion dead skin cells that's roughly the same number as there are roughly the same number as there are roughly the same number as there are stars in our Milky Way galaxy an average family of 2.6 people could an average family of 2.6 people could an average family of 2.6 people could cover the entire horizontal surface of cover the entire horizontal surface of cover the entire horizontal surface of an average 2 000 square foot home with a an average 2 000 square foot home with a an average 2 000 square foot home with a layer of skin cells one cell deep in layer of skin cells one cell deep in layer of skin cells one cell deep in around 200 days that is assuming all around 200 days that is assuming all

rinsed out in the wash not to mention dead skin cells shed not to mention dead skin cells shed not to mention dead skin cells shed outside the home outside the home outside the home still the amount of skin we shed is not still the amount of skin we shed is not still the amount of skin we shed is not small but how much is it as a percentage small but how much is it as a percentage small but how much is it as a percentage of household dust of household dust of household dust well that turns out to be a trickier well that turns out to be a trickier well that turns out to be a trickier question because there are a lot of question because there are a lot of question because there are a lot of other sources of dust like pollen fibers other sources of dust like pollen fibers other sources of dust like pollen fibers from rugs clothes and Furniture dirt from rugs clothes and Furniture dirt from rugs clothes and Furniture dirt from outside even micro meteorites dust from outside even micro meteorites dust from outside even micro meteorites dust from space from space from space [Music] [Music] [Music] to clear things up I called around to to clear things up I called around to to clear things up I called around to some dust experts and they pointed me to some dust experts and they pointed me to some dust experts and they pointed me to this book house dust biology by Johanna this book house dust biology by Johanna this book house dust biology by Johanna van Brunswick from 1981. and sure enough van Brunswick from 1981. and sure enough van Brunswick from 1981. and sure enough on page 37 there is this graph now it on page 37 there is this graph now it on page 37 there is this graph now it appears to show the fraction of skin appears to show the fraction of skin appears to show the fraction of skin particles in Airborne dust as 80 percent particles in Airborne dust as 80 percent particles in Airborne dust as 80 percent except not really this is a stacked area except not really this is a stacked area except not really this is a stacked area graph so dead skin accounts for only 20 graph so dead skin accounts for only 20 graph so dead skin accounts for only 20 percent of dust particles between 100 percent of dust particles between 100 percent of dust particles between 100 and 300 micrometers could a simple and 300 micrometers could a simple and 300 micrometers could a simple misunderstanding of this graph be the misunderstanding of this graph be the misunderstanding of this graph be the source of the urban legend I mean it's source of the urban legend I mean it's source of the urban legend I mean it's possible but what's more interesting to possible but what's more interesting to possible but what's more interesting to me is that the legend is not that far me is that the legend is not that far me is that the legend is not that far off according to this a full 50 percent off according to this a full 50 percent off according to this a full 50 percent of dust particles under 100 micrometers of dust particles under 100 micrometers of dust particles under 100 micrometers is dead human skin the book also reports is dead human skin the book also reports is dead human skin the book also reports on a study where they vacuumed a on a study where they vacuumed a on a study where they vacuumed a mattress and studied the resulting dust mattress and studied the resulting dust mattress and studied the resulting dust ball under the microscope 53 percent of ball under the microscope 53 percent of ball under the microscope 53 percent of the Dust was skin particles the Dust was skin particles the Dust was skin particles so the debunkers are debunked while not so the debunkers are debunked while not so the debunkers are debunked while not 70 to 80 percent dead skin cells do make 70 to 80 percent dead skin cells do make 70 to 80 percent dead skin cells do make up a significant portion of household up a significant portion of household up a significant portion of household dust of course the exact percentage dust of course the exact percentage dust of course the exact percentage depends a lot on how much other dust is depends a lot on how much other dust is depends a lot on how much other dust is contributed by the environment these contributed by the environment these contributed by the environment these studies were conducted in houses in the studies were conducted in houses in the studies were conducted in houses in the Netherlands which typically have Netherlands which typically have Netherlands which typically have hardwood floors and therefore less dust hardwood floors and therefore less dust hardwood floors and therefore less dust than homes with carpeting than homes with carpeting than homes with carpeting it also depends on how large of a it also depends on how large of a it also depends on how large of a particle you consider dust dead skin particle you consider dust dead skin particle you consider dust dead skin cells account for roughly half of these cells account for roughly half of these cells account for roughly half of these small dust particles but much less than small dust particles but much less than small dust particles but much less than half of what is sucked up by your vacuum half of what is sucked up by your vacuum half of what is sucked up by your vacuum cleaner cleaner cleaner oh that is gross unbelievable oh that is gross unbelievable oh that is gross unbelievable I guess it makes sense that the place I guess it makes sense that the place I guess it makes sense that the place where we find the most dead skin cells where we find the most dead skin cells where we find the most dead skin cells is in and around our beds where we spend is in and around our beds where we spend is in and around our beds where we spend a third of Our Lives shedding a third of a third of Our Lives shedding a third of a third of Our Lives shedding a third of our skin in our sleep our skin in our sleep our skin in our sleep so then is it true that your mattress so then is it true that your mattress so then is it true that your mattress actually doubles in weight every 10 actually doubles in weight every 10 actually doubles in weight every 10 years this claim was actually published years this claim was actually published years this claim was actually published in a major news Outlet 20 years ago with in a major news Outlet 20 years ago with in a major news Outlet 20 years ago with the increase in Mass attributed to dust the increase in Mass attributed to dust the increase in Mass attributed to dust mites that feed on your dead skin the mites that feed on your dead skin the mites that feed on your dead skin the claim which lacked a scientific claim which lacked a scientific claim which lacked a scientific reference is so disgusting it has spread reference is so disgusting it has spread reference is so disgusting it has spread throughout the internet but it's not throughout the internet but it's not throughout the internet but it's not true if two people slept on the same bed true if two people slept on the same bed true if two people slept on the same bed for a decade and even if all their dead for a decade and even if all their dead for a decade and even if all their dead skin cells ended up in the mattress it skin cells ended up in the mattress it skin cells ended up in the mattress it would only gain around three kilograms would only gain around three kilograms would only gain around three kilograms or seven pounds and by conservation of or seven pounds and by conservation of or seven pounds and by conservation of mass the dust mites that feed off that mass the dust mites that feed off that mass the dust mites that feed off that dead skin could not weigh more than that dead skin could not weigh more than that dead skin could not weigh more than that so the total weight gain would have to so the total weight gain would have to so the total weight gain would have to be less than 10 percent the weight of an be less than 10 percent the weight of an be less than 10 percent the weight of an average mattress and remember dead skin average mattress and remember dead skin average mattress and remember dead skin cells are small and light enough to cells are small and light enough to cells are small and light enough to become airborne just making the bed has become airborne just making the bed has become airborne just making the bed has been found to increase the number of been found to increase the number
