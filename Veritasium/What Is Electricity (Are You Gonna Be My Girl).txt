WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Go!! 1,2,3 a song about 'lectricty because it powers our lives, makes it possible for us to thrive because it powers our lives, makes it possible for us to thrive Oh, 4, 5, 6, volts of potential difference makes electrons go round if the circuit is complete and sound Circuit's closed Voltage There Current Flows Power Everywhere We use AC, in factories and homes because we can transform it High voltage transmits with lower loss but low voltage is best for safety I said what is electricity? Well, so 1,2,3 a song about 'lectricty because it powers our lives makes it possible for us to thrive because it powers our lives makes it possible for us to thrive Oh, 4, 5, 6, volts of potential difference makes electrons go round if the circuit is complete and sound Heat makes steam turns turbines and a magnet in coils of wires We use AC in factories and homes because we can transform it High voltage transmits with lower loss but low voltage is best for safety I said what is electricity? Oh yeah, Oh yeah, C'mon! How'd it be no energy of the electrical persuasion I know we'd have no computers no internet or mobile phones yeah Powers the world Makes the world We need electricity yeah
