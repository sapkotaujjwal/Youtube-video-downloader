WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Music] this is the ultimate test of aerogel I this is the ultimate test of aerogel I this is the ultimate test of aerogel I put myself on the line to see who wins put myself on the line to see who wins put myself on the line to see who wins in the Battle of flamethrower versus in the Battle of flamethrower versus in the Battle of flamethrower versus aerogel aerogel aerogel [Music] [Music] [Music] so if you really want to see the so if you really want to see the so if you really want to see the insulating properties of air gel you got insulating properties of air gel you got insulating properties of air gel you got to put it to the test and this material to put it to the test and this material to put it to the test and this material here is like the most insulating right here is like the most insulating right here is like the most insulating right what is this yeah so this is pyro gel what is this yeah so this is pyro gel what is this yeah so this is pyro gel xte it's made by Aspen aerogel so it's xte it's made by Aspen aerogel so it's xte it's made by Aspen aerogel so it's one centimeter thick it doesn't look one centimeter thick it doesn't look one centimeter thick it doesn't look like the blue stuff because it's like the blue stuff because it's like the blue stuff because it's actually a fiberglass blanket that's actually a fiberglass blanket that's actually a fiberglass blanket that's infused with aerogel by the blue stuff infused with aerogel by the blue stuff infused with aerogel by the blue stuff he means this silica aerogel it's made he means this silica aerogel it's made he means this silica aerogel it's made of the same material as sand or glass of the same material as sand or glass of the same material as sand or glass but if you zoom into the nanoscale you'd but if you zoom into the nanoscale you'd but if you zoom into the nanoscale you'd see it has a sponge-like structure with see it has a sponge-like structure with see it has a sponge-like structure with tiny pores just tens of nanometers tiny pores just tens of nanometers tiny pores just tens of nanometers across now aerogel can be up to 99.8% across now aerogel can be up to 99.8% across now aerogel can be up to 99.8% air but it's a better thermal insulator air but it's a better thermal insulator air but it's a better thermal insulator than air because those pores are so tiny than air because those pores are so tiny than air because those pores are so tiny that hot air struggles to diffuse that hot air struggles to diffuse that hot air struggles to diffuse through them plus the nanoscale through them plus the nanoscale through them plus the nanoscale structure itself is a poor conductor of structure itself is a poor conductor of structure itself is a poor conductor of heat but aerogel is pretty fragile in heat but aerogel is pretty fragile in heat but aerogel is pretty fragile in this form and so it's not really this form and so it's not really this form and so it's not really practical for most uses instead what you practical for most uses instead what you practical for most uses instead what you can do is actually take tiny particles can do is actually take tiny particles can do is actually take tiny particles of aerogel and embed them in a composite of aerogel and embed them in a composite of aerogel and embed them in a composite material like blankets but it has the material like blankets but it has the material like blankets but it has the additional component iron oxide just additional component iron oxide just additional component iron oxide just basically rust that makes it opaque to basically rust that makes it opaque to basically rust that makes it opaque to infrared radiation so it's good at infrared radiation so it's good at infrared radiation so it's good at stifling conduction convection and stifling conduction convection and stifling conduction convection and radiation and on the other side of this radiation and on the other side of this radiation and on the other side of this insulating aerogel blanket we have Ben insulating aerogel blanket we have Ben insulating aerogel blanket we have Ben who he's from Cape Cod and responded to who he's from Cape Cod and responded to who he's from Cape Cod and responded to a tweet of mine when I asked if anyone a tweet of mine when I asked if anyone a tweet of mine when I asked if anyone in this area has a flamethrower or a not in this area has a flamethrower or a not in this area has a flamethrower or a not a flamethrower in this case from the a flamethrower in this case from the a flamethrower in this case from the boring company have you ever fired this boring company have you ever fired this boring company have you ever fired this before I have not so this will be at before I have not so this will be at before I have not so this will be at first okay so what we're gonna do is try first okay so what we're gonna do is try first okay so what we're gonna do is try to test what the temperature is on the to test what the temperature is on the to test what the temperature is on the far side of that blanket when we put the far side of that blanket when we put the far side of that blanket when we put the flamethrower at full bore on to this flamethrower at full bore on to this flamethrower at full bore on to this side all right are you ready I'm ready side all right are you ready I'm ready side all right are you ready I'm ready all right let's give this a try right all right let's give this a try right all right let's give this a try right here I have the FLIR thermal camera this here I have the FLIR thermal camera this here I have the FLIR thermal camera this is the T 1020 which can record up to is the T 1020 which can record up to is the T 1020 which can record up to 2,000 degrees Celsius first for 2,000 degrees Celsius first for 2,000 degrees Celsius first for comparison let's see what this comparison let's see what this comparison let's see what this flamethrower can do to something that's flamethrower can do to something that's flamethrower can do to something that's not aerogel let's put it to the test on not aerogel let's put it to the test on not aerogel let's put it to the test on this super-sized this super-sized this super-sized she's kiss there you go all right Ben within seconds the temperature of the within seconds the temperature of the within seconds the temperature of the chocolate is up to hundreds of degrees chocolate is up to hundreds of degrees chocolate is up to hundreds of degrees Celsius around 30 seconds the whole thing starts around 30 seconds the whole thing starts around 30 seconds the whole thing starts to collapse even after the flamethrower is removed even after the flamethrower is removed even after the flamethrower is removed parts of the chocolate are still well parts of the chocolate are still well parts of the chocolate are still well over 600 degrees Celsius I think this is over 600 degrees Celsius I think this is over 600 degrees Celsius I think this is what the internet likes they like really what the internet likes they like really what the internet likes they like really hot things applied to you know novelty hot things applied to you know novelty hot things applied to you know novelty objects okay now is the time to really objects okay now is the time to really objects okay now is the time to really put aerogel to the test he's about to put aerogel to the test he's about to put aerogel to the test he's about to put the flame for our full bore on this put the flame for our full bore on this put the flame for our full bore on this side of the blanket just one centimeter side of the blanket just one centimeter side of the blanket just one centimeter away will be my hand on the backside of away will be my hand on the backside of away will be my hand on the backside of the blanket one heart one heart one heart come in not I don't feel any Heat that is crazy propane burns at about 2,000 Celsius so propane burns at about 2,000 Celsius so propane burns at about 2,000 Celsius so this point I barely feel anything that is incredible [Music] they look like from the back feels like feels warm what about the feels like feels warm what about the feels like feels warm what about the other side how hots the other side so other side how hots the other side so other side how hots the other side so this flame door was producing over 660 this flame door was producing over 660 this flame door was producing over 660 degrees Celsius on this side meanwhile degrees Celsius on this side meanwhile degrees Celsius on this side meanwhile on the other side we were just measuring on the other side we were just measuring on the other side we were just measuring about 50 degrees Celsius we're going up about 50 degrees Celsius we're going up about 50 degrees Celsius we're going up to the highest range that this camera to the highest range that this camera to the highest range that this camera can do up to 2000 degrees Celsius okay I can do up to 2000 degrees Celsius okay I can do up to 2000 degrees Celsius okay I know we're not gonna be able to see much know we're not gonna be able to see much know we're not gonna be able to see much except for the really hot stuff let's go except for the really hot stuff let's go except for the really hot stuff let's go for it that is just insane but this for it that is just insane but this for it that is just insane but this blanket is still not hot blanket is still not hot blanket is still not hot you see that with the thermal how hot is you see that with the thermal how hot is you see that with the thermal how hot is it 50 degrees see on the thermal I got it 50 degrees see on the thermal I got it 50 degrees see on the thermal I got 900 at one point yeah and it's actually 900 at one point yeah and it's actually 900 at one point yeah and it's actually still it's over 200 degrees Celsius still it's over 200 degrees Celsius still it's over 200 degrees Celsius right now whoa yeah right there and I right now whoa yeah right there and I right now whoa yeah right there and I can still touch it yeah can you see my can still touch it yeah can you see my can still touch it yeah can you see my handprints after I touched it Wow handprints after I touched it Wow handprints after I touched it Wow now you might be wondering how it's now you might be wondering how it's now you might be wondering how it's possible to touch something hotter than possible to touch something hotter than possible to touch something hotter than 100 degrees Celsius without getting 100 degrees Celsius without getting 100 degrees Celsius without getting burned well for that we need to go to burned well for that we need to go to burned well for that we need to go to another demonstration this is a hot another demonstration this is a hot another demonstration this is a hot plate set to around 150 degrees Celsius plate set to around 150 degrees Celsius plate set to around 150 degrees Celsius and on top of it is a metal plate that and on top of it is a metal plate that and on top of it is a metal plate that is mostly covered in about a millimeter is mostly covered in about a millimeter is mostly covered in about a millimeter of an air gel coating called of an air gel coating called of an air gel coating called air lawn but a small square in the air lawn but a small square in the air lawn but a small square in the corner is left uncovered this says about corner is left uncovered this says about corner is left uncovered this says about 120 627 degrees Celsius so clearly 120 627 degrees Celsius so clearly 120 627 degrees Celsius so clearly hotter than boiling water so would you hotter than boiling water so would you hotter than boiling water so would you put your hand in boiling water put your hand in boiling water put your hand in boiling water I don't think so that would hurt but I don't think so that would hurt but I don't think so that would hurt but what about putting it on this coating so what about putting it on this coating so what about putting it on this coating so let me try how's it feel not like 130 degrees it how's it feel not like 130 degrees it how's it feel not like 130 degrees it feels hot but yeah but it doesn't feel feels hot but yeah but it doesn't feel feels hot but yeah but it doesn't feel like 130 degrees I wonder to prove the like 130 degrees I wonder to prove the like 130 degrees I wonder to prove the point there's some water in a little point there's some water in a little point there's some water in a little beaker when I move that oh yeah your beaker when I move that oh yeah your beaker when I move that oh yeah your figure yeah totally your hand prints figure yeah totally your hand prints figure yeah totally your hand prints thermal handprints left behind so I was thermal handprints left behind so I was thermal handprints left behind so I was cooling down the surface cooling it down cooling down the surface cooling it down cooling down the surface cooling it down over here this is not coated and this is over here this is not coated and this is over here this is not coated and this is I think slightly hotter it's about it's I think slightly hotter it's about it's I think slightly hotter it's about it's Wow 180 degrees Celsius so that is the Wow 180 degrees Celsius so that is the Wow 180 degrees Celsius so that is the part I don't want to touch yeah I part I don't want to touch yeah I part I don't want to touch yeah I definitely don't want to touch it definitely don't want to touch it definitely don't want to touch it because it doesn't have Erica on it this because it doesn't have Erica on it this because it doesn't have Erica on it this is such a thin coating it's about a is such a thin coating it's about a is such a thin coating it's about a millimeter but even that millimeter of millimeter but even that millimeter of millimeter but even that millimeter of aerogel means that you can touch aerogel means that you can touch aerogel means that you can touch something that otherwise you would be something that otherwise you would be something that otherwise you would be totally unable to touch this would totally unable to touch this would totally unable to touch this would definitely burn you and that's why definitely burn you and that's why definitely burn you and that's why there's a little beaker of water with a there's a little beaker of water with a there's a little beaker of water with a dropper is there you go I moved it okay dropper is there you go I moved it okay dropper is there you go I moved it okay so take some of that and just to prove so take some of that and just to prove so take some of that and just to prove the point put it on the metal square let the point put it on the metal square let the point put it on the metal square let me put some of this on that piece of me put some of this on that piece of me put some of this on that piece of metal here I'm gonna drop a little bit metal here I'm gonna drop a little bit metal here I'm gonna drop a little bit of water on it so we can see this really of water on it so we can see this really of water on it so we can see this really cools the drops that splattered off onto cools the drops that splattered off onto cools the drops that splattered off onto the aerilon coating are not boiling the aerilon coating are not boiling the aerilon coating are not boiling let's have a look here and this water doesn't doesn't boil right there I don't know if this is right there I don't know if this is right there I don't know if this is gonna be like he trip he transferred gonna be like he trip he transferred gonna be like he trip he transferred through the water it gets hot put your through the water it gets hot put your through the water it gets hot put your finger on the air a lot itself without finger on the air a lot itself without finger on the air a lot itself without the water right like there yeah no big the water right like there yeah no big the water right like there yeah no big deal right deal right deal right yeah I mean that's not it's not yeah I mean that's not it's not yeah I mean that's not it's not uncomfortable it's clearly hot but it's uncomfortable it's clearly hot but it's uncomfortable it's clearly hot but it's but it's not like you know putting your but it's not like you know putting your but it's not like you know putting your hand in boiling water which is kind of hand in boiling water which is kind of hand in boiling water which is kind of crazy because it is hotter than boiling crazy because it is hotter than boiling crazy because it is hotter than boiling water but it just doesn't conduct the water but it just doesn't conduct the water but it just doesn't conduct the energy to your hand that fast that's energy to your hand that fast that's energy to your hand that fast that's really weird really weird really weird they use this for applications which they use this for applications which they use this for applications which they call safe touch so that's something they call safe touch so that's something they call safe touch so that's something that would normally instantly burn you that would normally instantly burn you that would normally instantly burn you something hot enough to boil water you something hot enough to boil water you something hot enough to boil water you could hold your hand on four minutes and could hold your hand on four minutes and could hold your hand on four minutes and it wouldn't at all okay so far in this it wouldn't at all okay so far in this it wouldn't at all okay so far in this video I focused on using air gel in hot video I focused on using air gel in hot video I focused on using air gel in hot applications but it works equally well applications but it works equally well applications but it works equally well at the other end of the temperature at the other end of the temperature at the other end of the temperature spectrum at cryogenic temperatures and spectrum at cryogenic temperatures and spectrum at cryogenic temperatures and this comes in handy for things like this comes in handy for things like this comes in handy for things like liquefied natural gas plants or by NASA liquefied natural gas plants or by NASA liquefied natural gas plants or by NASA when they're using liquid helium you when they're using liquid helium you when they're using liquid helium you need really good insulation to keep the need really good insulation to keep the need really good insulation to keep the heat out I mean those cold pipes if heat out I mean those cold pipes if heat out I mean those cold pipes if they're not insulated properly can end they're not insulated properly can end they're not insulated properly can end up with huge ice falls on them which not up with huge ice falls on them which not up with huge ice falls on them which not only is inefficient it's also incredibly only is inefficient it's also incredibly only is inefficient it's also incredibly dangerous so this is one of the major dangerous so this is one of the major dangerous so this is one of the major applications for aerogel these days if applications for aerogel these days if applications for aerogel these days if you take a piece of cryo gel and dip it you take a piece of cryo gel and dip it you take a piece of cryo gel and dip it in liquid nitrogen for a good while it in liquid nitrogen for a good while it in liquid nitrogen for a good while it is still flexible when you bring it out is still flexible when you bring it out is still flexible when you bring it out and that's kind of essential when you're and that's kind of essential when you're and that's kind of essential when you're working with material that needs to working with material that needs to working with material that needs to function at ultra cold temperatures here function at ultra cold temperatures here function at ultra cold temperatures here is a carbon aerogel that has been is a carbon aerogel that has been is a carbon aerogel that has been submerged in liquid nitrogen and as that submerged in liquid nitrogen and as that submerged in liquid nitrogen and as that liquid nitrogen turns back into the gas liquid nitrogen turns back into the gas liquid nitrogen turns back into the gas state it functions like its own air state it functions like its own air state it functions like its own air hockey puck except instead of the air hockey puck except instead of the air hockey puck except instead of the air coming from the table it comes from the coming from the table it comes from the coming from the table it comes from the puck itself you can even buy ski jackets puck itself you can even buy ski jackets puck itself you can even buy ski jackets these days that have special aerogel these days that have special aerogel these days that have special aerogel lined pockets that stay significantly lined pockets that stay significantly lined pockets that stay significantly warmer than standard jacket pockets and warmer than standard jacket pockets and warmer than standard jacket pockets and they're specially made for your cell they're specially made for your cell they're specially made for your cell phone so that it doesn't freeze up in phone so that it doesn't freeze up in phone so that it doesn't freeze up in the cold weather you know I feel like the cold weather you know I feel like the cold weather you know I feel like this is a story of something that this is a story of something that this is a story of something that started as an oddity as something that started as an oddity as something that started as an oddity as something that didn't really have applications but didn't really have applications but didn't really have applications but clearly is a anime clearly is a anime clearly is a anime insulation and can be made into a really insulation and can be made into a really insulation and can be made into a really strong fire retardant material why would strong fire retardant material why would strong fire retardant material why would they insulate subsea oil pipelines with they insulate subsea oil pipelines with they insulate subsea oil pipelines with this material that's a really this material that's a really this material that's a really interesting question so this was what we interesting question so this was what we interesting question so this was what we would call the killer app for aerogel would call the killer app for aerogel would call the killer app for aerogel the oil that comes out of wells in the the oil that comes out of wells in the the oil that comes out of wells in the deep ocean is very viscous and slaggy deep ocean is very viscous and slaggy deep ocean is very viscous and slaggy and so if you just had a pipe with that and so if you just had a pipe with that and so if you just had a pipe with that oil it would basically gum up and so oil it would basically gum up and so oil it would basically gum up and so what you have to do is put another pipe what you have to do is put another pipe what you have to do is put another pipe around it and fill that gap with around it and fill that gap with around it and fill that gap with insulation it's called a pipe and pipe insulation it's called a pipe and pipe insulation it's called a pipe and pipe configuration and so they heat the oil configuration and so they heat the oil configuration and so they heat the oil they have to keep it flowing but you they have to keep it flowing but you they have to keep it flowing but you need to insulate that so that it doesn't need to insulate that so that it doesn't need to insulate that so that it doesn't lose all of its heat to the cold lose all of its heat to the cold lose all of its heat to the cold temperatures of the surrounding ocean so temperatures of the surrounding ocean so temperatures of the surrounding ocean so if you think about laying pipes like if you think about laying pipes like if you think about laying pipes like that from a ship you have these long that from a ship you have these long that from a ship you have these long segments of pipe that the ship has to segments of pipe that the ship has to segments of pipe that the ship has to basically pick it off put over the side basically pick it off put over the side basically pick it off put over the side of the boat and drop down the ocean so of the boat and drop down the ocean so of the boat and drop down the ocean so you know at some point the pipe becomes you know at some point the pipe becomes you know at some point the pipe becomes so big and so heavy and capsized the so big and so heavy and capsized the so big and so heavy and capsized the boat so they're really only three boat so they're really only three boat so they're really only three vessels on the planet that we're big vessels on the planet that we're big vessels on the planet that we're big enough to lay that really large diameter enough to lay that really large diameter enough to lay that really large diameter pipe for subsoil pipelines Aspen pipe for subsoil pipelines Aspen pipe for subsoil pipelines Aspen aerogels came along and said hey guys aerogels came along and said hey guys aerogels came along and said hey guys we've got this really great new we've got this really great new we've got this really great new insulation it's three times better than insulation it's three times better than insulation it's three times better than polyurethane so I can take this much polyurethane so I can take this much polyurethane so I can take this much polyurethane foam and shrink it into an polyurethane foam and shrink it into an polyurethane foam and shrink it into an insulation that's that much aerogel now insulation that's that much aerogel now insulation that's that much aerogel now what it did was allowed you to shrink what it did was allowed you to shrink what it did was allowed you to shrink the outer diameter pipe of this pipe and the outer diameter pipe of this pipe and the outer diameter pipe of this pipe and pipe configuration substantially and pipe configuration substantially and pipe configuration substantially and because of that mass reduction from the because of that mass reduction from the because of that mass reduction from the smaller diameter pipe all of a sudden smaller diameter pipe all of a sudden smaller diameter pipe all of a sudden 250 ships around the world 250 ships around the world 250 ships around the world Callay that smaller diameter pipe Callay that smaller diameter pipe Callay that smaller diameter pipe without any loss of performance in the without any loss of performance in the without any loss of performance in the oil pipeline and so that resulted in oil pipeline and so that resulted in oil pipeline and so that resulted in alleviating years back logs of these alleviating years back logs of these alleviating years back logs of these pipe lines that need to get laid and pipe lines that need to get laid and pipe lines that need to get laid and save billions of billion stars now when save billions of billion stars now when save billions of billion stars now when we filmed this video I knew the title we filmed this video I knew the title we filmed this video I knew the title would probably be something like would probably be something like would probably be something like flamethrower versus aerogel but I didn't flamethrower versus aerogel but I didn't flamethrower versus aerogel but I didn't think of it like a real battle like what think of it like a real battle like what think of it like a real battle like what would it mean for the aerogel to win would it mean for the aerogel to win would it mean for the aerogel to win that it just you know didn't get hot or that it just you know didn't get hot or that it just you know didn't get hot or something but as it turns out in the something but as it turns out in the something but as it turns out in the flamethrower user manual it instructs flamethrower user manual it instructs flamethrower user manual it instructs you only to ever pull the trigger for you only to ever pull the trigger for you only to ever pull the trigger for seven seconds at a time seven seconds at a time seven seconds at a time maximum but to get the shot and to get maximum but to get the shot and to get maximum but to get the shot and to get the blanket hot enough I frequently told the blanket hot enough I frequently told the blanket hot enough I frequently told Ben to pull the trigger for 5 or 10 Ben to pull the trigger for 5 or 10 Ben to pull the trigger for 5 or 10 times that long times that long times that long that's like that was like triple okay that's like that was like triple okay that's like that was like triple okay and what we noticed over the course of and what we noticed over the course of and what we noticed over the course of the shoot was that the flamethrower was the shoot was that the flamethrower was the shoot was that the flamethrower was working less and less well and we working less and less well and we working less and less well and we thought it was out of fuel but it just thought it was out of fuel but it just thought it was out of fuel but it just turned out something inside it was turned out something inside it was turned out something inside it was breaking and by the end we couldn't even breaking and by the end we couldn't even breaking and by the end we couldn't even pull the trigger pull the trigger pull the trigger so I'm sorry Ben and in the battle of so I'm sorry Ben and in the battle of so I'm sorry Ben and in the battle of flamethrower versus air gel flamethrower versus air gel flamethrower versus air gel I think air gel definitely won you
