WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] you pitch that hey how did you do that that was a that hey how did you do that that was a that hey how did you do that that was a hard one because uh this ball is a hard one because uh this ball is a hard one because uh this ball is a little bit magic it's got a bit of little bit magic it's got a bit of little bit magic it's got a bit of string glue to the left side of it to string glue to the left side of it to string glue to the left side of it to make the ball curve to the left why is make the ball curve to the left why is make the ball curve to the left why is that and that's because the air that's that and that's because the air that's that and that's because the air that's flowing from the front of the ball flowing from the front of the ball flowing from the front of the ball around to the back Encounters this around to the back Encounters this around to the back Encounters this seam becomes turbulent and turbulent air seam becomes turbulent and turbulent air seam becomes turbulent and turbulent air air is known to stick to the ball longer air is known to stick to the ball longer air is known to stick to the ball longer than smooth or lamin flow and so the air than smooth or lamin flow and so the air than smooth or lamin flow and so the air is deflected this way to the right on is deflected this way to the right on is deflected this way to the right on the ball and therefore there's a force the ball and therefore there's a force the ball and therefore there's a force on the ball to the left and so it curves on the ball to the left and so it curves on the ball to the left and so it curves this is quite a light ball so it curves this is quite a light ball so it curves this is quite a light ball so it curves a long way uhuh but uh on a cricket ball a long way uhuh but uh on a cricket ball a long way uhuh but uh on a cricket ball the seam isn't on one side it seam is the seam isn't on one side it seam is the seam isn't on one side it seam is down the middle correct it's spinning in down the middle correct it's spinning in down the middle correct it's spinning in such a way that the seams inclined at an such a way that the seams inclined at an such a way that the seams inclined at an angle to the direction of motion of the angle to the direction of motion of the angle to the direction of motion of the ball I see in which case air coming ball I see in which case air coming ball I see in which case air coming towards the ball will flow smoothly towards the ball will flow smoothly towards the ball will flow smoothly around the smooth side and separates around the smooth side and separates around the smooth side and separates from the ball air flowing On The Rough from the ball air flowing On The Rough from the ball air flowing On The Rough Side the same side becomes turbulent as Side the same side becomes turbulent as Side the same side becomes turbulent as soon as it encounters that seam gets soon as it encounters that seam gets soon as it encounters that seam gets deflected to the left mhm and therefore deflected to the left mhm and therefore deflected to the left mhm and therefore the ball gets deflected to the right so the ball gets deflected to the right so the ball gets deflected to the right so you basically make a rough side using you basically make a rough side using you basically make a rough side using that seam by angling the seam with a that seam by angling the seam with a that seam by angling the seam with a cricket ball with a cricket ball or you cricket ball with a cricket ball or you cricket ball with a cricket ball or you can have a rough and a smooth side can have a rough and a smooth side can have a rough and a smooth side because as time goes on during the game because as time goes on during the game because as time goes on during the game one side gets rougher than the other the one side gets rougher than the other the one side gets rougher than the other the players maintain the smooth Side by players maintain the smooth Side by players maintain the smooth Side by polishing it or wherever as if as if polishing it or wherever as if as if polishing it or wherever as if as if they're scratching themselves right uh they're scratching themselves right uh they're scratching themselves right uh and then you don't really need the same and then you don't really need the same and then you don't really need the same for to have that effect cuz the effect for to have that effect cuz the effect for to have that effect cuz the effect is just a rough side and a smooth side is just a rough side and a smooth side is just a rough side and a smooth side so a ball will always swing towards the so a ball will always swing towards the so a ball will always swing towards the Rough Side then it does but how does Rough Side then it does but how does Rough Side then it does but how does someone swing a baseball then uh that someone swing a baseball then uh that someone swing a baseball then uh that relies on the Magnus of effect normally relies on the Magnus of effect normally relies on the Magnus of effect normally so if the if the spin is about a so if the if the spin is about a so if the if the spin is about a vertical axis it'll either curve to the vertical axis it'll either curve to the vertical axis it'll either curve to the left or curve to the right that's a left or curve to the right that's a left or curve to the right that's a curve ball uh curve ball uh curve ball uh exactly however uh there's a pitch ball exactly however uh there's a pitch ball exactly however uh there's a pitch ball known as a scuff ball that people don't known as a scuff ball that people don't known as a scuff ball that people don't like to know about CU it's like to know about CU it's like to know about CU it's illegal and if you're roughing up one illegal and if you're roughing up one illegal and if you're roughing up one side of the ball surreptitiously without side of the ball surreptitiously without side of the ball surreptitiously without anybody noticing it and then toss it uh anybody noticing it and then toss it uh anybody noticing it and then toss it uh it will curve a long way just like the it will curve a long way just like the it will curve a long way just like the cricket ball it'll curve towards the r cricket ball it'll curve towards the r cricket ball it'll curve towards the r side correct however there's an effect side correct however there's an effect side correct however there's an effect discovered just this year which is discovered just this year which is discovered just this year which is fairly obvious when you think about it fairly obvious when you think about it fairly obvious when you think about it you can have a smooth patch on a you can have a smooth patch on a you can have a smooth patch on a baseball but I mean the seam seems to be baseball but I mean the seam seems to be baseball but I mean the seam seems to be symmetric everywhere so how can you symmetric everywhere so how can you symmetric everywhere so how can you really have a smooth patch what you do really have a smooth patch what you do really have a smooth patch what you do there is to make sure the axis passes there is to make sure the axis passes there is to make sure the axis passes through a spot which is a large distance through a spot which is a large distance through a spot which is a large distance from the seam in other words right about from the seam in other words right about from the seam in other words right about there it's about 1 in away from the seam there it's about 1 in away from the seam there it's about 1 in away from the seam and if it rotates about that axis then and if it rotates about that axis then and if it rotates about that axis then you've got a big spot that's always you've got a big spot that's always you've got a big spot that's always smooth on that side got a Smooth Spot as smooth on that side got a Smooth Spot as smooth on that side got a Smooth Spot as opposed to a rough spot and so it swings opposed to a rough spot and so it swings opposed to a rough spot and so it swings away from the Smooth Spot it does and I away from the Smooth Spot it does and I away from the Smooth Spot it does and I can show you that in slow motion ah so can show you that in slow motion ah so can show you that in slow motion ah so you've tried this out with one of your you've tried this out with one of your you've tried this out with one of your poly siren balls I have so that you can poly siren balls I have so that you can poly siren balls I have so that you can see the effect more dramatically but see the effect more dramatically but see the effect more dramatically but it's also on film from a real baseball it's also on film from a real baseball it's also on film from a real baseball match in April this year it was filmed match in April this year it was filmed match in April this year it was filmed and notice for the first time that it's and notice for the first time that it's and notice for the first time that it's curving the wrong curving the wrong curving the wrong [Music] [Music] [Music] way so who was it who explained this so who was it who explained this so who was it who explained this effect effect effect me you were the first person to explain me you were the first person to explain me you were the first person to explain how you can cause a a baseball to swing how you can cause a a baseball to swing how you can cause a a baseball to swing in the opposite direction I took an aie in the opposite direction I took an aie in the opposite direction I took an aie to show uh show The Americans how it's to show uh show The Americans how it's to show uh show The Americans how it's done exactly uhhuh well why don't we uh done exactly uhhuh well why don't we uh done exactly uhhuh well why don't we uh why don't we play a bit of ball but with why don't we play a bit of ball but with why don't we play a bit of ball but with that thing I don't think you can swing that thing I don't think you can swing that thing I don't think you can swing that as much I can't yeah so let's give that as much I can't yeah so let's give that as much I can't yeah so let's give it a shot
