Norton 360 classical mechanics is great Norton 360 classical mechanics is great if you know the state of a system say if you know the state of a system say if you know the state of a system say the position and velocity of a particle the position and velocity of a particle the position and velocity of a particle then you can use an equation Newton's then you can use an equation Newton's then you can use an equation Newton's second law to calculate what that second law to calculate what that second law to calculate what that particle will do in the future in particle will do in the future in particle will do in the future in quantum mechanics if you know the quantum mechanics if you know the quantum mechanics if you know the quantum state of a particle that is its quantum state of a particle that is its quantum state of a particle that is its wave function you can use the wave function you can use the wave function you can use the Schrodinger equation to calculate what Schrodinger equation to calculate what Schrodinger equation to calculate what that particle will do in the future that particle will do in the future that particle will do in the future usually it spreads out over time as it usually it spreads out over time as it usually it spreads out over time as it is doing here note to make this is doing here note to make this is doing here note to make this animation we really solved the animation we really solved the animation we really solved the Schrodinger equation so there's a Schrodinger equation so there's a Schrodinger equation so there's a beautiful symmetry here if you know the beautiful symmetry here if you know the beautiful symmetry here if you know the initial state you can use an equation to initial state you can use an equation to initial state you can use an equation to evolve that state smoothly and evolve that state smoothly and evolve that state smoothly and continuously into the future the problem continuously into the future the problem continuously into the future the problem is in quantum mechanics we never is in quantum mechanics we never is in quantum mechanics we never actually observe the wave function like actually observe the wave function like actually observe the wave function like this instead when we measure it we find this instead when we measure it we find this instead when we measure it we find the particle at a single point in space the particle at a single point in space the particle at a single point in space so how are we to reconcile the so how are we to reconcile the so how are we to reconcile the spread-out wavefunction evolving spread-out wavefunction evolving spread-out wavefunction evolving smoothly under the Schrodinger equation smoothly under the Schrodinger equation smoothly under the Schrodinger equation with this point like particle detection with this point like particle detection with this point like particle detection now I think it's understandable that now I think it's understandable that now I think it's understandable that when the founders of quantum theory when the founders of quantum theory when the founders of quantum theory approached this problem they considered approached this problem they considered approached this problem they considered the measurement more real than the the measurement more real than the the measurement more real than the wavefunction after all the measurement wavefunction after all the measurement wavefunction after all the measurement was something we had actually observed was something we had actually observed was something we had actually observed and it matches our experience of a world and it matches our experience of a world and it matches our experience of a world of matter particles it was harder to say of matter particles it was harder to say of matter particles it was harder to say what the wavefunction was exactly what the wavefunction was exactly what the wavefunction was exactly Schrodinger formulated his wave equation Schrodinger formulated his wave equation Schrodinger formulated his wave equation because scientists notably debroglie because scientists notably debroglie because scientists notably debroglie suspected that matter has wave-like suspected that matter has wave-like suspected that matter has wave-like properties but it took a third physicist properties but it took a third physicist properties but it took a third physicist Max Born to propose how we should Max Born to propose how we should Max Born to propose how we should interpret the wave function at each interpret the wave function at each interpret the wave function at each point in space the wave function has a point in space the wave function has a point in space the wave function has a complex amplitude essentially just a complex amplitude essentially just a complex amplitude essentially just a real number plus an imaginary number Max real number plus an imaginary number Max real number plus an imaginary number Max Born suggested if you take that Born suggested if you take that Born suggested if you take that amplitude and square it you get the amplitude and square it you get the amplitude and square it you get the probability of finding the particle probability of finding the particle probability of finding the particle there the fact that you have to square there the fact that you have to square there the fact that you have to square the amplitude actually appears as a last the amplitude actually appears as a last the amplitude actually appears as a last minute footnote in boran's paper but minute footnote in boran's paper but minute footnote in boran's paper but that is how probability was introduced that is how probability was introduced that is how probability was introduced into the core of our picture of reality into the core of our picture of reality into the core of our picture of reality that's a pretty big philosophical leap I that's a pretty big philosophical leap I that's a pretty big philosophical leap I mean no longer is the universe mean no longer is the universe mean no longer is the universe deterministic deterministic deterministic this made a lot of scientists especially this made a lot of scientists especially this made a lot of scientists especially Einstein uncomfortable but the born rule Einstein uncomfortable but the born rule Einstein uncomfortable but the born rule as it is now called remains at the heart as it is now called remains at the heart as it is now called remains at the heart of quantum mechanics because it is of quantum mechanics because it is of quantum mechanics because it is spectacularly successful at predicting spectacularly successful at predicting spectacularly successful at predicting the outcomes of experiments so the way the outcomes of experiments so the way the outcomes of experiments so the way quantum mechanics came to be understood quantum mechanics came to be understood quantum mechanics came to be understood and the way I learned it is that there and the way I learned it is that there and the way I learned it is that there are two sets of rules when you're not are two sets of rules when you're not are two sets of rules when you're not looking the wave function simply evolves looking the wave function simply evolves looking the wave function simply evolves according to the Schrodinger equation according to the Schrodinger equation according to the Schrodinger equation but when you are looking when you make a but when you are looking when you make a but when you are looking when you make a measurement the wavefunction collapses measurement the wavefunction collapses measurement the wavefunction collapses suddenly and irreversibly and the suddenly and irreversibly and the suddenly and irreversibly and the probability of measuring any particular probability of measuring any particular probability of measuring any particular outcome is given by the amplitude of the outcome is given by the amplitude of the outcome is given by the amplitude of the wave function associated with that wave function associated with that wave function associated with that outcome squared now Schrodinger himself outcome squared now Schrodinger himself outcome squared now Schrodinger himself hated this formulation which is actually hated this formulation which is actually hated this formulation which is actually why he invented the famous Schrodinger's why he invented the famous Schrodinger's why he invented the famous Schrodinger's cat thought experiment put a cat in a cat thought experiment put a cat in a cat thought experiment put a cat in a box with a radioactive atom add a box with a radioactive atom add a box with a radioactive atom add a radiation detector that triggers the radiation detector that triggers the radiation detector that triggers the release of poisonous cyanide gas now release of poisonous cyanide gas now release of poisonous cyanide gas now although it was only meant as a thought although it was only meant as a thought although it was only meant as a thought experiment Schrodinger helpfully notes experiment Schrodinger helpfully notes experiment Schrodinger helpfully notes this device must be secured against this device must be secured against this device must be secured against direct interference by the cat anyway direct interference by the cat anyway direct interference by the cat anyway the whole point of the experiment is to the whole point of the experiment is to the whole point of the experiment is to magnify the state of the atom up to the magnify the state of the atom up to the magnify the state of the atom up to the state of something macroscopic and state of something macroscopic and state of something macroscopic and tangible he could have picked anything tangible he could have picked anything tangible he could have picked anything it didn't have to be alive but it didn't have to be alive but it didn't have to be alive but Schrodinger selected a cat if the atom Schrodinger selected a cat if the atom Schrodinger selected a cat if the atom decays the detector detects radiation decays the detector detects radiation decays the detector detects radiation releases the poison and the cat dies if releases the poison and the cat dies if releases the poison and the cat dies if the atom doesn't decay the detector the atom doesn't decay the detector the atom doesn't decay the detector doesn't detect radiation poison is not doesn't detect radiation poison is not doesn't detect radiation poison is not released and the cat remains alive since released and the cat remains alive since released and the cat remains alive since the state of the cat and detector the state of the cat and detector the state of the cat and detector apparatus are directly tied to the state apparatus are directly tied to the state apparatus are directly tied to the state of the atom we say they are entangled of the atom we say they are entangled of the atom we say they are entangled where things get weird is that according where things get weird is that according where things get weird is that according to quantum mechanics the state of the to quantum mechanics the state of the to quantum mechanics the state of the atom does not have to be either decayed atom does not have to be either decayed atom does not have to be either decayed or not decayed generally it's in a or not decayed generally it's in a or not decayed generally it's in a superposition of both decayed and not superposition of both decayed and not superposition of both decayed and not decayed at the same time assuming no decayed at the same time assuming no decayed at the same time assuming no measurements have been made this measurements have been made this measurements have been made this superposition state of the atom gets superposition state of the atom gets superposition state of the atom gets entangled with the detector and then the entangled with the detector and then the entangled with the detector and then the cat so after some time the wavefunction cat so after some time the wavefunction cat so after some time the wavefunction of everything inside the box is in a of everything inside the box is in a of everything inside the box is in a superposition of the atom has not superposition of the atom has not superposition of the atom has not decayed poison not released cat a live decayed poison not released cat a live decayed poison not released cat a live state and the atom has decayed poison state and the atom has decayed poison state and the atom has decayed poison released cat dead released cat dead released cat dead date so according to quantum mechanics date so according to quantum mechanics date so according to quantum mechanics the cat really is both alive and dead at the cat really is both alive and dead at the cat really is both alive and dead at the same time only when we open the box the same time only when we open the box the same time only when we open the box and make a measurement does the and make a measurement does the and make a measurement does the wavefunction collapse and the cat wavefunction collapse and the cat wavefunction collapse and the cat actually becomes either dead or alive actually becomes either dead or alive actually becomes either dead or alive these days Schrodinger's cat is often these days Schrodinger's cat is often these days Schrodinger's cat is often used as a way to show how weird quantum used as a way to show how weird quantum used as a way to show how weird quantum mechanics is but that wasn't mechanics is but that wasn't mechanics is but that wasn't Schrodinger's point he wanted to show Schrodinger's point he wanted to show Schrodinger's point he wanted to show that quantum mechanics as formulated was that quantum mechanics as formulated was that quantum mechanics as formulated was wrong so taking up Schrodinger's wrong so taking up Schrodinger's wrong so taking up Schrodinger's argument in this video I want to show argument in this video I want to show argument in this video I want to show that there is a better way to think that there is a better way to think that there is a better way to think about Schrodinger's cat about Schrodinger's cat about Schrodinger's cat in fact a better way to think about in fact a better way to think about in fact a better way to think about quantum mechanics entirely that I'd quantum mechanics entirely that I'd quantum mechanics entirely that I'd argue is more logical and consistent to argue is more logical and consistent to argue is more logical and consistent to get there we have to examine the three get there we have to examine the three get there we have to examine the three essential components of Schrodinger's essential components of Schrodinger's essential components of Schrodinger's cat superposition entanglement and cat superposition entanglement and cat superposition entanglement and measurement to see if any of them is measurement to see if any of them is measurement to see if any of them is flawed the superposition is the idea flawed the superposition is the idea flawed the superposition is the idea that quantum objects can be in two that quantum objects can be in two that quantum objects can be in two different states at the same time this different states at the same time this different states at the same time this seems like a crazy idea and something seems like a crazy idea and something seems like a crazy idea and something we'd never observe but we do indirectly we'd never observe but we do indirectly we'd never observe but we do indirectly with the double slit experiment fire with the double slit experiment fire with the double slit experiment fire individual electrons through two slits individual electrons through two slits individual electrons through two slits at a screen and the pattern you see is at a screen and the pattern you see is at a screen and the pattern you see is not just the sum of electrons going not just the sum of electrons going not just the sum of electrons going separately through one slit and the separately through one slit and the separately through one slit and the other slit it is an interference pattern other slit it is an interference pattern other slit it is an interference pattern we are forced to conclude that a single we are forced to conclude that a single we are forced to conclude that a single electron somehow goes through one slit electron somehow goes through one slit electron somehow goes through one slit and the other slit simultaneously and the other slit simultaneously and the other slit simultaneously this is superposition of course it's this is superposition of course it's this is superposition of course it's easy to understand superposition with easy to understand superposition with easy to understand superposition with waves they are spread out in space and waves they are spread out in space and waves they are spread out in space and it's clear how the peak of a wave from it's clear how the peak of a wave from it's clear how the peak of a wave from one slit cancels with the trough of the one slit cancels with the trough of the one slit cancels with the trough of the wave from another slit to produce the wave from another slit to produce the wave from another slit to produce the interference pattern and luckily we know interference pattern and luckily we know interference pattern and luckily we know that when we're not looking electrons that when we're not looking electrons that when we're not looking electrons are represented by a wave the wave are represented by a wave the wave are represented by a wave the wave function the double slit experiment then function the double slit experiment then function the double slit experiment then is concrete evidence that this wave is concrete evidence that this wave is concrete evidence that this wave enables individual electrons to pass enables individual electrons to pass enables individual electrons to pass through both slits at the same time so through both slits at the same time so through both slits at the same time so superposition is on solid ground the superposition is on solid ground the superposition is on solid ground the next concept is entanglement consider next concept is entanglement consider next concept is entanglement consider two electrons fired toward each other two electrons fired toward each other two electrons fired toward each other with equal and opposite velocities we with equal and opposite velocities we with equal and opposite velocities we know they will scatter off each other know they will scatter off each other know they will scatter off each other but we don't know exactly how their but we don't know exactly how their but we don't know exactly how their trajectories are given by spread out trajectories are given by spread out trajectories are given by spread out wave functions that only give us wave functions that only give us wave functions that only give us probabilities probabilities probabilities but as soon as we measure the momentum but as soon as we measure the momentum but as soon as we measure the momentum of one of the electrons we immediately of one of the electrons we immediately of one of the electrons we immediately know the momentum of the other one it know the momentum of the other one it know the momentum of the other one it must be equal and opposite otherwise must be equal and opposite otherwise must be equal and opposite otherwise conservation of momentum would be conservation of momentum would be conservation of momentum would be violated now this may seem obvious but violated now this may seem obvious but violated now this may seem obvious but consider that before the measurement the consider that before the measurement the consider that before the measurement the momentum of each electron was in a momentum of each electron was in a momentum of each electron was in a superposition of states measuring one superposition of states measuring one superposition of states measuring one instantaneously collapsed the instantaneously collapsed the instantaneously collapsed the wavefunction of the other and this would wavefunction of the other and this would wavefunction of the other and this would be true even if those electrons were be true even if those electrons were be true even if those electrons were light-years apart these electrons are light-years apart these electrons are light-years apart these electrons are entangled what's really going on here is entangled what's really going on here is entangled what's really going on here is that after interacting the electrons do that after interacting the electrons do that after interacting the electrons do not have separate wave functions at all not have separate wave functions at all not have separate wave functions at all they are described by a single wave they are described by a single wave they are described by a single wave function and this is what it means to be function and this is what it means to be function and this is what it means to be entangled this explains why measuring entangled this explains why measuring entangled this explains why measuring one immediately affects the state of the one immediately affects the state of the one immediately affects the state of the other one because the single wave other one because the single wave other one because the single wave function has collapsed in fact if we function has collapsed in fact if we function has collapsed in fact if we were being rigorous we'd have to say were being rigorous we'd have to say were being rigorous we'd have to say that there is only one wave function the that there is only one wave function the that there is only one wave function the wave function of the entire universe wave function of the entire universe wave function of the entire universe which includes absolutely everything but which includes absolutely everything but which includes absolutely everything but in the case of isolated unentangled in the case of isolated unentangled in the case of isolated unentangled quantum particles we can reasonably talk quantum particles we can reasonably talk quantum particles we can reasonably talk about their individual wave functions about their individual wave functions about their individual wave functions and then once they interact with and then once they interact with and then once they interact with something else entanglement is the something else entanglement is the something else entanglement is the result so what we've seen is result so what we've seen is result so what we've seen is superposition is really the same thing superposition is really the same thing superposition is really the same thing as describing systems with waves an as describing systems with waves an as describing systems with waves an entanglement means that after particles entanglement means that after particles entanglement means that after particles interact they are described by a single interact they are described by a single interact they are described by a single wave function these are fundamental wave function these are fundamental wave function these are fundamental parts of quantum theory describing parts of quantum theory describing parts of quantum theory describing systems with wave functions that evolve systems with wave functions that evolve systems with wave functions that evolve according to the Schrodinger equation according to the Schrodinger equation according to the Schrodinger equation which leaves only measurement remember which leaves only measurement remember which leaves only measurement remember the measurement postulate was added as a the measurement postulate was added as a the measurement postulate was added as a second set of rules to connect the second set of rules to connect the second set of rules to connect the mathematics of quantum mechanics to what mathematics of quantum mechanics to what mathematics of quantum mechanics to what we actually observe but doesn't it seem we actually observe but doesn't it seem we actually observe but doesn't it seem weird that there should be one rule for weird that there should be one rule for weird that there should be one rule for how systems evolve when we're not how systems evolve when we're not how systems evolve when we're not looking and a different rule for when we looking and a different rule for when we looking and a different rule for when we are when you boil it down measurement is are when you boil it down measurement is are when you boil it down measurement is just the interaction of one quantum just the interaction of one quantum just the interaction of one quantum system electrons and photons with system electrons and photons with system electrons and photons with another quantum system and we know another quantum system and we know another quantum system and we know exactly how to deal with that we simply exactly how to deal with that we simply exactly how to deal with that we simply evolve their wave functions according to evolve their wave functions according to evolve their wave functions according to the Schrodinger equation so what if we the Schrodinger equation so what if we the Schrodinger equation so what if we throw out all the rules associated with throw out all the rules associated with throw out all the rules associated with measurement well then in the measurement well then in the measurement well then in the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment Schrodinger's cat thought experiment Schrodinger's cat thought experiment the radioactive atom in a superposition the radioactive atom in a superposition the radioactive atom in a superposition of decayed and not decayed gets of decayed and not decayed gets of decayed and not decayed gets entangled with the detector and in turn entangled with the detector and in turn entangled with the detector and in turn the cat now remember we are also made of the cat now remember we are also made of the cat now remember we are also made of electrons and atoms which obey the laws electrons and atoms which obey the laws electrons and atoms which obey the laws of quantum mechanics so we are quantum of quantum mechanics so we are quantum of quantum mechanics so we are quantum mechanical - so when we open the box mechanical - so when we open the box mechanical - so when we open the box there is no measurement no wavefunction there is no measurement no wavefunction there is no measurement no wavefunction collapse we simply get entangled with collapse we simply get entangled with collapse we simply get entangled with the state of everything inside the box the state of everything inside the box the state of everything inside the box so we see the cat alive and we see the so we see the cat alive and we see the so we see the cat alive and we see the cat dead now how is that possible I'm cat dead now how is that possible I'm cat dead now how is that possible I'm guessing you've never seen both an alive guessing you've never seen both an alive guessing you've never seen both an alive and dead cat before but the solution is and dead cat before but the solution is and dead cat before but the solution is it's because the you that saw the cat it's because the you

the wave function of the universe the wave function of the universe essentially essentially essentially splitting the universe into two slightly splitting the universe into two slightly splitting the universe into two slightly different copies so a more realistic different copies so a more realistic different copies so a more realistic account of Schrodinger's cat goes like account of Schrodinger's cat goes like account of Schrodinger's cat goes like this the radioactive atom evolves from this the radioactive atom evolves from this the radioactive atom evolves from 100% not decayed into a quantum 100% not decayed into a quantum 100% not decayed into a quantum superposition of decayed and not decayed superposition of decayed and not decayed superposition of decayed and not

atom but the superposition state of the atom but the detector is being bombarded by all these detector is being bombarded by all these detector is being bombarded by all these air molecules and photons in the box air molecules and photons in the box air molecules and photons in the box which would bounce off differently if it which would bounce off differently if it which would bounce off differently if it is detected radiation than if it hasn't is detected radiation than if it hasn't is detected radiation than if it hasn't so almost immediately the detector so almost immediately the detector so almost immediately the detector becomes entangled with the state of the becomes entangled with the state of the becomes entangled with the state of the environment it D coheres branching

interpretation of quantum mechanics is called many worlds and it mechanics is called many worlds and it mechanics is called many worlds and it was formulated by Hugh Everett and if was formulated by Hugh Everett and if was formulated by Hugh Everett and if it's true the branching of the it's true the branching of the it's true the branching of the wavefunction is happening all the time

requires something like the collapse of requires something like the collapse of requires something like the collapse of the wavefunction and the point is our the wavefunction and the point is our the

many-worlds picture as it is if in the many-worlds picture as it is if the wavefunction collapses but the the wavefunction collapses but the the wavefunction collapses but the formalism is so much cleaner and more formalism is so much cleaner and more formalism is so much cleaner and more elegant all we have are wave functions elegant all we have are wave functions elegant all we have are wave

function universe branches its wave function right so branching is happening many right so branching is happening many right so branching is happening many many times a second just because a many times a second just because a many times a second just because a radioactive decays in your body now is radioactive decays in your body now is radioactive decays in your body now is it happening infinitely often we don't it happening infinitely often we don't it happening infinitely often we don't know because we don't know whether the know because we don't know whether the know because we don't know whether the total number of possible branches is total number of possible branches is total number of possible branches is infinitely big or finite its joy mungus infinitely big or finite its joy mungus infinitely big or finite its joy mungus by any stretch there's plenty of room by any stretch there's plenty of room by any stretch there's plenty of room for all these branches to exist and it for all these branches to exist and it for all these branches to exist and it might very well be finite but that the might very well be finite but that the might very well be finite but that the details hinge on things we don't details hinge on things we don't details hinge on things we don't understand about quantum gravity and understand about quantum gravity and understand about quantum gravity and cosmology and the theory of everything cosmology and the theory of everything cosmology and the theory of everything and all that stuff so it's a big number and all that stuff so it's a big number and all that stuff so it's a big number but we don't know how big let's deal but we don't know how big let's deal but we don't know how big let's deal with the misconception that many-worlds with the misconception that many-worlds with the misconception that many-worlds means everything that could possibly means everything that could possibly means everything that could possibly happen happens yeah that's not true many happen happens yeah that's not true many happen happens yeah that's not true many worlds means the wavefunction obeys the worlds means the wavefunction obeys the worlds means the wavefunction obeys the Schrodinger equation that's what it Schrodinger equation that's what it Schrodinger equation that's what it means the Schrodinger equation predicts means the Schrodinger equation predicts means the Schrodinger equation predicts many things could potentially happen but many things could potentially happen but many things could potentially happen but not everything so for example an not everything so for example an not everything so for example an electron will never convert into a electron will never convert into a electron will never convert into a proton it would violate conservation of proton it would violate conservation of proton it would violate conservation of mass conservation of charge all of these mass conservation of charge all of these mass conservation of charge all of these things things of the Schrodinger things things of the Schrodinger things things of the Schrodinger equation gives zero probability to ever equation gives zero probability to ever equation gives zero probability to ever happening what about you becoming happening what about you becoming happening what about you becoming president yes that could happen there president yes that could happen there president yes that could happen there there is a world in which you're there is a world in which you're there is a world in which you're president there is a world well to be president there is a world well to be president there is a world well to be SuperDuper clear SuperDuper clear SuperDuper clear not be me who is president Raney a not be me who is president Raney a not be me who is president Raney a version of me right right but there is version of me right right but there is version of me right right but there is the branching happens your those are two the branching happens your those are two the branching happens your those are two separate people now but there is a separate people now but there is a separate people now but there is a version of you who is currently version of you who is currently version of you who is currently president yes that's right and who was president yes that's right and who was president yes that's right and who was tweeting it's a very low amplitude world tweeting it's a very low amplitude world tweeting it's a very low amplitude world it's a very small probability but it's it's a very small probability but it's it's a very small probability but it's there yes I mean I think this is the way there yes I mean I think this is the way there yes I mean I think this is the way in which it feels more complicated than in which it feels more complicated than in which it feels more complicated than or it feels more ridiculous then or it feels more ridiculous then or it feels more ridiculous then Copenhagen because Copenhagen's like Copenhagen because Copenhagen's like Copenhagen because Copenhagen's like there's just one world this is it that's there's just one world this is it that's there's just one world this is it that's what you experience and but look the what you experience and but look the what you experience and but look the universe the good old universe universe the good old universe universe the good old universe forget about quantum mechanics okay just forget about quantum mechanics okay just forget about quantum

everything we see all the galaxies and everything we don't see the whole universe we see a don't see the whole universe we see a don't see the whole universe we see a finite amount of it because light moves finite amount of it because light moves finite amount of it because light moves at the speed of lights is a place beyond at the speed of lights is a place beyond at the speed of lights is a place beyond which we can't see the universe could be which we can't see the universe could be which we can't see the universe could be infinitely big we don't know infinitely big we don't know infinitely big we don't know it's certainly very plausible universe it's certainly very plausible universe it's certainly very plausible universe is infinitely big it's plausible that is infinitely big it's plausible that is infinitely big it's plausible that everywhere in the universe looks more or everywhere in the universe looks more or everywhere in the universe looks more or less like what we see with galaxies and less like what we see with galaxies and less like what we see with galaxies and stars in the whole bit if that's true stars in the whole bit if that's true stars in the whole bit if that's true there's an infinite number of copies of there's an infinite number of copies of there's an infinite number of copies of people exactly like you some of them are people exactly like

of them are championships some of them are championships some of them are supermodels whatever this just because supermodels whatever this just because supermodels whatever this just because there's a lot of different shuffling there's a lot of different shuffling there's a lot of different shuffling around of the atoms okay has nothing to around of the atoms okay has nothing to around of the atoms okay has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or weirdness do with quantum mechanics or weirdness do with quantum mechanics or weirdness does that bother you does that like rub does that bother you does that like rub does that bother you does that like rub you the wrong way you the wrong way you the wrong way kind of I think but but but I agree it's kind of I think but but but I agree it's kind of I think but but but I agree it's less weird than the quantum idea and I less weird than the quantum idea and I less weird than the quantum idea and I think in both cases it's it's because think in both cases it's it's because think in both cases it's it's because you know human beings there's some you know human beings there's some you know human beings there's some cognitive bias I don't know what it's cognitive bias I don't know what it's cognitive bias I don't know what it's called but there's a cognitive bias that called but there's a cognitive bias that called but there's a cognitive bias that says the only probabilities for anything says the only probabilities for anything says the only probabilities for anything or 0% 50% 100% and when I tell you or 0% 50% 100% and when I tell you or 0% 50% 100% and when I tell you something can happen but the probability something can happen but the probability something can happen but the probability is really really really really really is really really really really really is really really really really really really really really low you feel like really really really low you feel like really really really low you feel like but it could happen but it could happen but it could happen let me focus on that come on that let me focus on that come on that let me focus on that come on that possibility that it happens I'm like no possibility that it happens I'm like no possibility that it happens I'm like no don't do that it's just not sufficiently don't do that it's just not sufficiently don't do that it's just not sufficiently probable that it's worth worrying about probable that it's worth worrying about probable that it's worth worrying about in any way when the world branches here in any way when the world branches here in any way when the world branches here does it branch instantly far away does it branch instantly far away does it branch instantly far away the answer is it's up to you this is the the answer is it's up to you this is the the answer is it's up to you this is the annoying part of the answer I can write annoying part of the answer I can write annoying part of the answer I can write down a description in which the down a description in which the down a description in which the branching happens instantly throughout branching happens instantly throughout branching happens instantly throughout all of space I use that description to all of space I use that description to all of space I use that description to make predictions about what people will make predictions about what people will make predictions about what people will see all those predictions come out see all those predictions come out see all those predictions come out percent completely true I can write an percent completely true I can write an percent completely true I can write an alternative description in which the alternative description in which the alternative description in which the branching sort of spreads out of the branching sort of spreads out of the branching sort of spreads out of the speed of light and I make a different speed of light and I make a different speed of light and I make a different set of predictions but guess what set of predictions but guess what set of predictions but guess what they're exactly the same predictions they're exactly the same predictions they're exactly the same predictions there's no difference between what those there's no difference between what those there's no difference between what those two pictures actually predict and what two pictures actually predict and what two pictures actually predict and what this is reflecting is God doesn't know this is reflecting is God doesn't know this is reflecting is God doesn't know about branches about branches about branches there's the wave function of the there's the wave function of the there's the wave function of the universe that's all it really exists universe that's all it really exists universe that's all it really exists okay okay okay breaking the wave function the universe breaking the wave function the universe breaking the wave function the universe into different pieces that you and I into different pieces that you and I into different pieces that you and I call branches or Worlds is very call branches or Worlds is very call branches or Worlds is very

that's a convenient description for us human beings it's not the full for us human beings it's not the full for us human beings it's not the full description of the reality and branches description of the reality and branches description of the reality and branches are exactly the same way so if you get are exactly the same way so if you get are exactly the same way so if you get annoyed that there's two different ways annoyed that there's two different ways annoyed that there's two different ways of describing the branching you have to of describing the branching you have to of describing the branching you have to remember that the whole idea of remember that the whole idea of remember that the whole idea of branching is just a human convenience branching is just a human convenience
