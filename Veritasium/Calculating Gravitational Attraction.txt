WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en most people recognize that the most people recognize that the most people recognize that the gravitational force attracts them gravitational force attracts them gravitational force attracts them towards the Earth and keeps them stuck towards the Earth and keeps them stuck towards the Earth and keeps them stuck on the on the on the planet but the gravitational force does planet but the gravitational force does planet but the gravitational force does so much more than that it attracts any so much more than that it attracts any so much more than that it attracts any object with mass towards any other object with mass towards any other object with mass towards any other object with mass so for example this object with mass so for example this object with mass so for example this table is attracted gravitationally to table is attracted gravitationally to table is attracted gravitationally to the chair and the chair is attracted to the chair and the chair is attracted to the chair and the chair is attracted to the table this this is a beautiful the table this this is a beautiful the table this this is a beautiful symmetric idea because it means that symmetric idea because it means that symmetric idea because it means that every object you can see around you is every object you can see around you is every object you can see around you is attracted to you gravitationally and you attracted to you gravitationally and you attracted to you gravitationally and you are attracted to it the reason we don't are attracted to it the reason we don't are attracted to it the reason we don't notice that attraction is because the notice that attraction is because the notice that attraction is because the force is so small so today I'd like to force is so small so today I'd like to force is so small so today I'd like to show you how to calculate the size of show you how to calculate the size of show you how to calculate the size of the force of attraction between any two the force of attraction between any two the force of attraction between any two masses so in this example we'll call masses so in this example we'll call masses so in this example we'll call this Mass one and this object Mass 2 this Mass one and this object Mass 2 this Mass one and this object Mass 2 the force is proportional to mass one so the force is proportional to mass one so the force is proportional to mass one so the larger Mass one is the bigger the the larger Mass one is the bigger the the larger Mass one is the bigger the force is the force is also proportional force is the force is also proportional force is the force is also proportional to mass two the bigger that mass is the to mass two the bigger that mass is the to mass two the bigger that mass is the bigger the force is now the force is bigger the force is now the force is bigger the force is now the force is what we call inversely proportional to what we call inversely proportional to what we call inversely proportional to the distance between them squared so if the distance between them squared so if the distance between them squared so if the distance between their centers is the distance between their centers is the distance between their centers is called r are then the further apart they called r are then the further apart they called r are then the further apart they are the smaller this force is and that are the smaller this force is and that are the smaller this force is and that makes makes makes sense now to make this a true equality sense now to make this a true equality sense now to make this a true equality we need to add Big G the universal we need to add Big G the universal we need to add Big G the universal gravitational constant this is just a gravitational constant this is just a gravitational constant this is just a number a constant of the universe which number a constant of the universe which number a constant of the universe which tells us how strong the gravitational tells us how strong the gravitational tells us how strong the gravitational force is this number G is force is this number G is force is this number G is 6.67 * 10 the 6.67 * 10 the 6.67 * 10 the -1 -1 -1 Newton m squar per kilogram Newton m squar per kilogram Newton m squar per kilogram squar as you can see it's a pretty small squar as you can see it's a pretty small squar as you can see it's a pretty small number so the force is going to be number so the force is going to be number so the force is going to be relatively small so let's do an example relatively small so let's do an example relatively small so let's do an example let's calculate the force of attraction let's calculate the force of attraction let's calculate the force of attraction between me and say hello de this is my between me and say hello de this is my between me and say hello de this is my twin brother Hi twin brother Hi twin brother Hi everybody so the force f is going to be everybody so the force f is going to be everybody so the force f is going to be equal to the gravitational constant 6.6 equal to the gravitational constant 6.6 equal to the gravitational constant 6.6 7 * 10 7 * 10 7 * 10 -1 time my mass which is 70 kg * de's -1 time my mass which is 70 kg * de's -1 time my mass which is 70 kg * de's Mass which is 70 kg oh no I thought you Mass which is 70 kg oh no I thought you Mass which is 70 kg oh no I thought you were putting on a little weight no hey were putting on a little weight no hey were putting on a little weight no hey 70 70 70 70 70 70 kg and divide by the distance between us kg and divide by the distance between us kg and divide by the distance between us which is what do you say about 1.5 which is what do you say about 1.5 which is what do you say about 1.5 M don't forget to square it I wasn't M don't forget to square it I wasn't M don't forget to square it I wasn't going to going to going to forget okay so this work works out to be forget okay so this work works out to be forget okay so this work works out to be 1.45 * 10 1.45 * 10 1.45 * 10 -7 Newtons there is a 10th of a -7 Newtons there is a 10th of a -7 Newtons there is a 10th of a millionth of a Newton attracting me and millionth of a Newton attracting me and millionth of a Newton attracting me and deck and that's not all dude now A newton is the amount of dude now A newton is the amount of dude now A newton is the amount of attracted to attracted to attracted to me
