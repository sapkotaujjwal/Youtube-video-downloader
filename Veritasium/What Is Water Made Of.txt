And everyone's heard of H2O, but planet. And everyone's heard of H2O, but planet. And everyone's heard of H2O, but do they know what it means? Do you know do they know what it means? Do you know do they know what it means? Do you know what water's made up of? what water's made up of? what water's made up of? H2O. Hydrogen and oxygen. It's made up H2O. Hydrogen and oxygen. It's made up H2O. Hydrogen and oxygen. It's made up of hydrogen and oxygen. of hydrogen and oxygen. of hydrogen and oxygen. H2O. H2O. H2O. H2O. H2O. H2O. Everyone knows the formula for water. Everyone knows the formula for water. Everyone knows the formula for water. H2O. H2O. H2O. No clue. Oxygen. Water. I don't know. No clue. Oxygen. Water. I don't know. No clue. Oxygen. Water. I don't know. Hydrogen. Hydrogen. Hydrogen. Oxygen. Oxygen. Oxygen. Carbon. Carbon. Carbon. No, it's hydrogen. No, it's hydrogen. No, it's hydrogen. So, it's hydrogen time and oxygen. So, it's hydrogen time and oxygen. So, it's hydrogen time and oxygen. Do you think you could maybe draw a Do you think you could maybe draw a Do you think you could maybe draw a water molecule if water molecule if water molecule if Yeah. From Oh, beautiful. I'm impressed. Yeah. From Oh, beautiful. I'm impressed. Yeah. From Oh, beautiful. I'm impressed. Great. Didn't get a level, a star for Great. Didn't get a level, a star for Great. Didn't get a level, a star for nothing. [laughter] nothing. [laughter] nothing. [laughter] Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen. Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen. Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen. It's a little harder than it seems. It It's a little harder than it seems. It It's a little harder than it seems. It would seem would seem would seem a water molecule. I can have a go. a water molecule. I can have a go. a water molecule. I can have a go. That's pretty good. I like that. That's pretty good. I like that. That's pretty good. I like that. Water molecule. And do you know what um Water molecule. And do you know what um Water molecule. And do you know what um water is made out of scientifically water is made out of scientifically water is made out of scientifically speaking? speaking? speaking? No, I don't. No, I don't. No, I don't. Water molecule. H2O. Uh, Water molecule. H2O. Uh, Water molecule. H2O. Uh, very nice. very nice. very nice. Two H's and an O. H2O. What's the O Two H's and an O. H2O. What's the O Two H's and an O. H2O. What's the O stand for? stand for? stand for? Oxygen. [laughter] Who knows? Together you guys could be Who knows? Together you guys could be Who knows? Together you guys could be inventing cold fusion.
