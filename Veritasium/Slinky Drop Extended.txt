WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en all right you've made your prediction all right you've made your prediction all right you've made your prediction and we've tied a tennis ball to the base and we've tied a tennis ball to the base and we've tied a tennis ball to the base of the slinky here and now we're going of the slinky here and now we're going of the slinky here and now we're going to extend it and drop it and see what to extend it and drop it and see what to extend it and drop it and see what happens to the tennis happens to the tennis happens to the tennis ball the heavy weight of the tennis ball ball the heavy weight of the tennis ball ball the heavy weight of the tennis ball is going to stretch the spring a little is going to stretch the spring a little is going to stretch the spring a little bit further so I'm going to cheat a bit further so I'm going to cheat a bit further so I'm going to cheat a little bit by shortening it a fraction little bit by shortening it a fraction little bit by shortening it a fraction at the top all right so we can see both at the top all right so we can see both at the top all right so we can see both the top and bottom ends sounds good and the top and bottom ends sounds good and the top and bottom ends sounds good and on the count of three I'll drop it ready on the count of three I'll drop it ready on the count of three I'll drop it ready one two three one two three one two three whoa what did you see there it fell very whoa what did you see there it fell very whoa what did you see there it fell very rapidly I need to look at that rapidly I need to look at that rapidly I need to look at that inflamation to see what's going on all inflamation to see what's going on all inflamation to see what's going on all right let's go to the slow motion right let's go to the slow motion right let's go to the slow motion [Music] [Music] [Music] footage so when you watch that you see footage so when you watch that you see footage so when you watch that you see that the tennis ball it really remains that the tennis ball it really remains that the tennis ball it really remains stationary until the whole Slinky is stationary until the whole Slinky is stationary until the whole Slinky is collapsed above it correct the the uh collapsed above it correct the the uh collapsed above it correct the the uh White force acting on the tennis ball is White force acting on the tennis ball is White force acting on the tennis ball is counted by the tension force acting counted by the tension force acting counted by the tension force acting upwards until the information travels upwards until the information travels upwards until the information travels down the slinky that the tension has down the slinky that the tension has down the slinky that the tension has changed it's really quite strange changed it's really quite strange changed it's really quite strange because it's as though the falling because it's as though the falling because it's as though the falling Slinky can support the tennis ball in a Slinky can support the tennis ball in a Slinky can support the tennis ball in a way uh that's what it looks like and way uh that's what it looks like and way uh that's what it looks like and indeed that's what it's indeed that's what it's indeed that's what it's doing I just find that so amazing and so doing I just find that so amazing and so doing I just find that so amazing and so counterintuitive we study physic because counterintuitive we study physic because counterintuitive we study physic because lots of unexpected things happen and lots of unexpected things happen and lots of unexpected things happen and it's those unexpected things that make it's those unexpected things that make it's those unexpected things that make physics interesting it's uh it's really physics interesting it's uh it's really physics interesting it's uh it's really strange it's like uh if you were falling strange it's like uh if you were falling strange it's like uh if you were falling out of a plane and you had a big enough out of a plane and you had a big enough out of a plane and you had a big enough Slinky you might uh be okay for a little Slinky you might uh be okay for a little Slinky you might uh be okay for a little while I wouldn't try it though you're while I wouldn't try it though you're while I wouldn't try it though you're better off with a parachute exactly all better off with a parachute exactly all better off with a parachute exactly all right well thanks Rod much appreciated right well thanks Rod much appreciated right well thanks Rod much appreciated your uh your help today it's been fun
