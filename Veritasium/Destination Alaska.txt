WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'm just packing my bag for Alaska and I'm just packing my bag for Alaska and I'm just packing my bag for Alaska and if you want to know why I'm going to if you want to know why I'm going to if you want to know why I'm going to Alaska well you're not the only one it Alaska well you're not the only one it Alaska well you're not the only one it seems I've become the why guy on a new seems I've become the why guy on a new seems I've become the why guy on a new Morning Show on Channel 10 called Morning Show on Channel 10 called Morning Show on Channel 10 called breakfast now have you ever found breakfast now have you ever found breakfast now have you ever found yourself just saying why you've seen yourself just saying why you've seen yourself just saying why you've seen something you thought something you just something you thought something you just something you thought something you just gone why well that's why we have our why gone why well that's why we have our why gone why well that's why we have our why guide Dr Derek Mal he's here to answer guide Dr Derek Mal he's here to answer guide Dr Derek Mal he's here to answer all the questions so I'm going to play all the questions so I'm going to play all the questions so I'm going to play you a clip of the live interview I did you a clip of the live interview I did you a clip of the live interview I did this morning talking about why I'm going this morning talking about why I'm going this morning talking about why I'm going up to Alaska and the one that I have for up to Alaska and the one that I have for up to Alaska and the one that I have for him right now is what is a solar burp is him right now is what is a solar burp is him right now is what is a solar burp is is the sun got indigestion what's going is the sun got indigestion what's going is the sun got indigestion what's going on with this yeah well uh it's actually on with this yeah well uh it's actually on with this yeah well uh it's actually not really called a solar burp but a not really called a solar burp but a not really called a solar burp but a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection solar flare or a coronal mass ejection solar flare or a coronal mass ejection but you can basically think of it as the but you can basically think of it as the but you can basically think of it as the sun giving out a burp which just belches sun giving out a burp which just belches sun giving out a burp which just belches pieces of itself into space and these pieces of itself into space and these pieces of itself into space and these are the images that we're seeing because are the images that we're seeing because are the images that we're seeing because this is this only happens every now and this is this only happens every now and this is this only happens every now and then doesn't it well basically every 11 then doesn't it well basically every 11 then doesn't it well basically every 11 years a bit like clockwork the sun will years a bit like clockwork the sun will years a bit like clockwork the sun will break out in spots and start spewing out break out in spots and start spewing out break out in spots and start spewing out these these hot gases uh fast moving these these hot gases uh fast moving these these hot gases uh fast moving charge particles and it just sprays it charge particles and it just sprays it charge particles and it just sprays it out into space out into space out into space why Derek why well the sun has uh is why Derek why well the sun has uh is why Derek why well the sun has uh is made of plasma and it has these big big made of plasma and it has these big big made of plasma and it has these big big magnetic fields within it they get all magnetic fields within it they get all magnetic fields within it they get all bunched up coiled up every 11 years and bunched up coiled up every 11 years and bunched up coiled up every 11 years and they sort of spring outwards um to a they sort of spring outwards um to a they sort of spring outwards um to a lower energy State when they do that lower energy State when they do that lower energy State when they do that they they send all this matter out into they they send all this matter out into they they send all this matter out into space but why Derek I'm just kid the space but why Derek I'm just kid the space but why Derek I'm just kid the other question I have is what effects other question I have is what effects other question I have is what effects does this have on us here on Earth do we does this have on us here on Earth do we does this have on us here on Earth do we have any kind of impact on us well there have any kind of impact on us well there have any kind of impact on us well there are some beautiful effects if we get are some beautiful effects if we get are some beautiful effects if we get just a bit of it uh it'll create the just a bit of it uh it'll create the just a bit of it uh it'll create the Aurora the beautiful Northern or Aurora the beautiful Northern or Aurora the beautiful Northern or Southern light so you can see those over Southern light so you can see those over Southern light so you can see those over Tasmania uh or even over the North Pole Tasmania uh or even over the North Pole Tasmania uh or even over the North Pole around there but there can also be some around there but there can also be some around there but there can also be some negative impacts it can U knock out our negative impacts it can U knock out our negative impacts it can U knock out our satellites it can destroy um it can satellites it can destroy um it can satellites it can destroy um it can destroy satellites it can cause problems destroy satellites it can cause problems destroy satellites it can cause problems with our power grids how long's this with our power grids how long's this with our power grids how long's this expected to last for well a few years so expected to last for well a few years so expected to last for well a few years so every 11 years it sort of there's a peak every 11 years it sort of there's a peak every 11 years it sort of there's a peak for about a year or two but there's for about a year or two but there's for about a year or two but there's nothing for us to worry about from the nothing for us to worry about from the nothing for us to worry about from the whole you know that concept of a solar whole you know that concept of a solar whole you know that concept of a solar flare being big enough just doing golf F flare being big enough just doing golf F flare being big enough just doing golf F in that se kind either uh no we're far in that se kind either uh no we're far in that se kind either uh no we're far enough away from the Sun that by the enough away from the Sun that by the enough away from the Sun that by the time it reaches us it's the solar flare time it reaches us it's the solar flare time it reaches us it's the solar flare is basically spread out you're now on is basically spread out you're now on is basically spread out you're now on the record of saying that no one can the record of saying that no one can the record of saying that no one can hold you uh that's right well the UK has hold you uh that's right well the UK has hold you uh that's right well the UK has actually added the sort of solar actually added the sort of solar actually added the sort of solar activity to their list of National activity to their list of National activity to their list of National Security threats so you know if if the Security threats so you know if if the Security threats so you know if if the storm is big enough so the sun is now a storm is big enough so the sun is now a storm is big enough so the sun is now a terrorist in a way yeah in 1989 all of terrorist in a way yeah in 1989 all of terrorist in a way yeah in 1989 all of power was knocked out to Quebec uh power was knocked out to Quebec uh power was knocked out to Quebec uh because of one of these solar storms because of one of these solar storms because of one of these solar storms yeah now I'm very jealous you're heading yeah now I'm very jealous you're heading yeah now I'm very jealous you're heading up to Alaska you're talking about the up to Alaska you're talking about the up to Alaska you're talking about the Aurora what are you going to do when you Aurora what are you going to do when you Aurora what are you going to do when you get there well what we're going to go do get there well what we're going to go do get there well what we're going to go do is launch HD cameras on weather balloons is launch HD cameras on weather balloons is launch HD cameras on weather balloons and we're going to send them up into the and we're going to send them up into the and we're going to send them up into the atmosphere so we're the first team ever atmosphere so we're the first team ever atmosphere so we're the first team ever to to do this and we're going to look at to to do this and we're going to look at to to do this and we're going to look at the Aurora from inside film it in HD and the Aurora from inside film it in HD and the Aurora from inside film it in HD and color so how are you going to find these color so how are you going to find these color so how are you going to find these little things you're sticking them in little things you're sticking them in little things you're sticking them in weather balloons or something how you weather balloons or something how you weather balloons or something how you going to track them down cuz they got going to track them down cuz they got going to track them down cuz they got they're not going to come down where you they're not going to come down where you they're not going to come down where you want them yeah so we're going to have to want them yeah so we're going to have to want them yeah so we're going to have to put some sort of homing beacons on them put some sort of homing beacons on them put some sort of homing beacons on them and then we're going to have to Trek out and then we're going to have to Trek out and then we're going to have to Trek out through the Wilderness on dog sleds and through the Wilderness on dog sleds and through the Wilderness on dog sleds and choppers and stuff and try to find this choppers and stuff and try to find this choppers and stuff and try to find this stuff so what are you going to do when stuff so what are you going to do when stuff so what are you going to do when you get that Vision do we get a chance you get that Vision do we get a chance you get that Vision do we get a chance to have a look at it up on big screen to have a look at it up on big screen to have a look at it up on big screen Absolutely I'll come and I'll I'll bring Absolutely I'll come and I'll I'll bring Absolutely I'll come and I'll I'll bring it back and we can have a look at what it back and we can have a look at what it back and we can have a look at what we see why Derek well I think everyone we see why Derek well I think everyone we see why Derek well I think everyone wants to know wants to know wants to know it and if we know more about it it and if we know more about it it and if we know more about it hopefully we can you know predict these hopefully we can you know predict these hopefully we can you know predict these solar events in future and we can be solar events in future and we can be solar events in future and we can be better prepared you know it can expose a better prepared you know it can expose a better prepared you know it can expose a lot of people to radiation so if you're lot of people to radiation so if you're lot of people to radiation so if you're flying over the poles you might actually flying over the poles you might actually flying over the poles you might actually have to have your your flight rerooted have to have your your flight rerooted have to have your your flight rerooted if you're going to get hit by this this if you're going to get hit by this this if you're going to get hit by this this burst of uh particles coming from the burst of uh particles coming from the burst of uh particles coming from the Sun so it does actually have some kind Sun so it does actually have some kind Sun so it does actually have some kind of imp it has major impacts on us uh you of imp it has major impacts on us uh you of imp it has major impacts on us uh you know it's a it's a significant threat I know it's a it's a significant threat I know it's a it's a significant threat I have one more question for you here it have one more question for you here it have one more question for you here it says here that the total energy radiated says here that the total energy radiated says here that the total energy radiated by the sun averages 383 billion trillion by the sun averages 383 billion trillion by the sun averages 383 billion trillion that sounds my billion billion trillion that sounds my billion billion trillion that sounds my billion billion trillion wat kilowatts there you go okay yeah wat kilowatts there you go okay yeah wat kilowatts there you go okay yeah it's still a ridiculous number it's a it's still a ridiculous number it's a it's still a ridiculous number it's a it's a huge ridiculous number if we it's a huge ridiculous number if we it's a huge ridiculous number if we wrote it up here it would take the whole wrote it up here it would take the whole wrote it up here it would take the whole board to write it up I mean the sun board to write it up I mean the sun board to write it up I mean the sun admits a crazy amount of energy but uh admits a crazy amount of energy but uh admits a crazy amount of energy but uh most of it doesn't hit the earth of most of it doesn't hit the earth of most of it doesn't hit the earth of course because all of that energy course because all of that energy course because all of that energy spreads out in space so we just get a spreads out in space so we just get a spreads out in space so we just get a tiny fraction of it I could sit here and tiny fraction of it I could sit here and tiny fraction of it I could sit here and say why all day dere thank you so much say why all day dere thank you so much say why all day dere thank you so much it's a pleasure if you want to see more it's a pleasure if you want to see more it's a pleasure if you want to see more of the show you may want to check out of the show you may want to check out of the show you may want to check out the link in the description and if you the link in the description and if you the link in the description and if you want to see
