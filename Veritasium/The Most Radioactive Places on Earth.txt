WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Music] so I'm not be H it's overloaded radiation is frightening at least radiation is frightening at least radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my guer certain types of it are I mean my guer certain types of it are I mean my guer counter doesn't go off near my mobile counter doesn't go off near my mobile counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wii router or my microwave phone or the Wii router or my microwave phone or the Wii router or my microwave that's because a geiger counter only that's because a geiger counter only that's because a geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is measures ionizing radiation that is measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip radiation with enough energy to rip radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in electrons off atoms and it's measured in electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called CTS if you're exposed to units called CTS if you're exposed to units called CTS if you're exposed to more than two CTS all at once you'll more than two CTS all at once you'll more than two CTS all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but probably die shortly after that but probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing we're exposed to low levels of ionizing we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for radiation all the time bananas for radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some example are rich in potassium and some example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally of that potassium is naturally of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana radioactive so when you eat a banana radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 you're actually exposed to about 0.1 you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro CTS of radiation that's 1 10 micro CTS of radiation that's 1 10 micro CTS of radiation that's 1 10 millionth of a SE let's use a banana for millionth of a SE let's use a banana for millionth of a SE let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since scale of radiation doses you know since scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive people eat bananas we become radioactive people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more too so you're actually exposed to more too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone radiation if you sleep next to someone radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about about that because that dose worry about about that because that dose worry about about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the Natural is insignificant compared to the Natural is insignificant compared to the Natural background radiation of Earth I mean background radiation of Earth I mean background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of there's ionizing radiation coming out of there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and the soil and the rocks and the air and the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation even from space the level of radiation even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about .15 micro per here in Sydney is about .15 micro per here in Sydney is about .15 micro per hour and that's about average globally hour and that's about average globally hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between .1 and2 micro the levels usually between .1 and2 micro the levels usually between .1 and2 micro CS per hour but there are places with CS per hour but there are places with CS per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on significantly higher levels so who on significantly higher levels so who on Earth do you think receives the maximum Earth do you think receives the maximum Earth do you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer dose of ionizing radiation let's answer dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most that question by going to the most that question by going to the most radioactive places on radioactive places on radioactive places on Earth some places you'd expect to have Earth some places you'd expect to have Earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise high levels of radiation might surprise high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in hirosima and that is the you I'm in hirosima and that is the you I'm in hirosima and that is the peace Dome it was about 600 m above that peace Dome it was about 600 m above that peace Dome it was about 600 m above that Dome where the world's first nuclear Dome where the world's first nuclear Dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was bomb was detonated over a city it was bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum detonated there to have maximum detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of destructive impact with a level of destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is radiation today almost 70 years later is radiation today almost 70 years later is only3 micro CS per hour I'm about to get into the uh an elevator I'm about to get into the uh an elevator I'm about to get into the uh an elevator we're going down in a m shaft this is an we're going down in a m shaft this is an we're going down in a m shaft this is an old uh uranium mine this is the mine old uh uranium mine this is the mine old uh uranium mine this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where discovered it's also the place where discovered it's also the place where Marie kir obtained her raw material 17 Marie kir obtained her raw material 17 Marie kir obtained her raw material 17 micro per hour it's about 10 times the micro per hour it's about 10 times the micro per hour it's about 10 times the natural background that you would have natural background that you would have natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been nowadays most of the uranium has been nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a removed but in this wall there's still a removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV small piece and you can see under UV small piece and you can see under UV light it light it light it flues look at that fluorescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie C she won ore this is the lab of Marie C she won ore this is the lab of Marie C she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one two Nobel prizes one in physics and one two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and uh she conducted a lot in chemistry and uh she conducted a lot in chemistry and uh she conducted a lot of her work of her work of her work here and this is her office here and this is her office here and this is her office she would have sat right there she would have sat right there she would have sat right there apparently there are only a few parts of apparently there are only a few parts of apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive this area which are still radioactive this area which are still radioactive one is this door knob well it climbs not one is this door knob well it climbs not one is this door knob well it climbs not not much but but that's like 10 times not much but but that's like 10 times not much but but that's like 10 times the background the background the background yes more that's in and another is the yes more that's in and another is the yes more that's in and another is the back of her chair you can still detect back of her chair you can still detect back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot alpha particles coming off this spot alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was right here apparently after she was right here apparently after she was working in the lab she would come open working in the lab she would come open working in the lab she would come open the door the door the door leaving traces of radium here and then leaving traces of radium here and then leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New go and pull out her chair welcome to New go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear site where the world's first nuclear site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in bomb was set off right here right in bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in spot this whole area was vaporized in spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by fact there was so much heat liberated by fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the that bomb that it fused all of the that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this Green Glass and desert sand into this Green Glass and desert sand into this Green Glass and you can still find it here they've you can still find it here they've you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the actually named this mineral after the actually named this mineral after the test it's called test it's called test it's called trinitite yeah this is the only place on trinitite yeah this is the only place on trinitite yeah this is the only place on Earth that this has ever been made the Earth that this has ever been made the Earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 8 micro level of radiation here is about 8 micro level of radiation here is about 8 micro an hour the trinitite itself is a little an hour the trinitite itself is a little an hour the trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive I've got readings bit more radioactive I've got readings bit more radioactive I've got readings of two or three micro an hour off them of two or three micro an hour off them of two or three micro an hour off them now which place has higher levels of now which place has higher levels of now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so radiation than anywhere we've seen so radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know far the answer is an airplane you know far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less as you gain altitude there's less as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to Shield you from atmosphere above you to Shield you from atmosphere above you to Shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation cosmic rays so the level of radiation cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to.5 micro inside the plane can go up to.5 micro inside the plane can go up to.5 micro per hour at 18,000 ft up to 1 micr per per hour at 18,000 ft up to 1 micr per per hour at 18,000 ft up to 1 micr per hour at 23,000 ft over two micr per hour hour at 23,000 ft over two micr per hour hour at 23,000 ft over two micr per hour at 33,000 ft and over three micro cerss at 33,000 ft and over three micro cerss at 33,000 ft and over three micro cerss per hour at even higher altitudes and per hour at even higher altitudes and per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number that is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number that is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26th four it melted down on April 26th four it melted down on April 26th 1986 so what happened was so much heat 1986 so what happened was so much heat 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that was generated inside that reactor that was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading it basically blew the top off spreading it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this radioactive isotopes throughout this radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into to whole surrounding area and over into to whole surrounding area and over into to Europe and that is why we can still Europe and that is why we can still Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now detect the contamination here today now detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around 5 micro an right now it's reading around 5 micro an right now it's reading around 5 micro an hour if I stayed here for 1 hour my body hour if I stayed here for 1 hour my body hour if I stayed here for 1 hour my body would receive a similar dose to what would receive a similar dose to what would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental you'd receive when you get a dental you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of x-ray so this is not a huge amount of x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is radiation level is not too high is radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple because they actually removed a couple because they actually removed a couple meters worth of top soil from this whole meters worth of top soil from this whole meters worth of top soil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere area then they dumped it somewhere area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're uh driving into the Fukushima here we're uh driving into the Fukushima here we're uh driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as exclusion zone now I'm just watching as exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geer caner go up as we the levels on my Geer caner go up as we the levels on my Geer caner go up as we approach the Zone see those black bags approach the Zone see those black bags approach the Zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are at the side of the road the Japanese are at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in doing now exactly what the people in doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and Chernobyl did collecting up meters and Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of top soil the mask is probably the mask is probably the mask is probably Overkill it's just to stop radioactive Overkill it's just to stop radioactive Overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is dust from getting into my lungs this is dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive definitely one of the most radioactive definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the places where I've been even though the places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less release of radioactive material was less release of radioactive material was less than Chernobyl only about than Chernobyl only about than Chernobyl only about 10% because it's much fresher only 3 10% because it's much fresher only 3 10% because it's much fresher only 3 years since the accident much less of it years since the accident much less of it years since the accident much less of it has has has decayed so I've been getting readings up decayed so I've been getting readings up decayed so I've been getting readings up around 5 to 10 Micro an hour and uh I around 5 to 10 Micro an hour and uh I around 5 to 10 Micro an hour and uh I think we won't be staying here for too think we won't be staying here for too think we won't be staying here for too long because of long because of long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital that I'm about to go into the hospital that I'm about to go into the hospital at at at Prat and this is where the firemen were Prat and this is where the firemen were Prat and this is where the firemen were taken after they bought the fires at the taken after they bought the fires at the taken after they bought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the this building they have left all of the this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it firemen's clothing once they realized it firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they they chucked it was so contaminated they they chucked it was so contaminated they they chucked it down there out of the there out of the there out of the room that room that room that she there is she there is she there is but you can see there's a huge pile of but you can see there's a huge pile of but you can see there's a huge pile of that gear there right outside the door that gear there right outside the door that gear there right outside the door I'm getting 500 micro sus an hour just I'm getting 500 micro sus an hour just I'm getting 500 micro sus an hour just outside the outside the outside the door 1,500 micro CS an hour you know if door 1,500 micro CS an hour you know if door 1,500 micro CS an hour you know if we stayed here for a couple hours we'd we stayed here for a couple hours we'd we stayed here for a couple hours we'd receive an annual dose of background radiation that basement was the most radiation that basement was the most radiation that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one radioactive place I visited and it's one radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on Earth of the most radioactive places on Earth of the most radioactive places on Earth if ID stayed down there for 1 hour I if ID stayed down there for 1 hour I if ID stayed down there for 1 hour I would have received 2,000 micro seers would have received 2,000 micro seers would have received 2,000 micro seers that's a Year's worth of natural that's a Year's worth of natural that's a Year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel background radiation every yellow pixel background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might here represents a banana now that might here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a seem like a lot but consider that in a seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro CS that's 3 years worth of natural micro CS that's 3 years worth of natural micro CS that's 3 years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated background radiation it's been estimated background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima that the people living around Fukushima that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro will receive an additional 10,000 micro will receive an additional 10,000 micro over their lifetime due to the nuclear over their lifetime due to the nuclear over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster power disaster power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are for comparison us radiation workers are for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 micro limited to a maximum of 50,000 micro limited to a maximum of 50,000 micro certs per year but that's less than certs per year but that's less than certs per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an another occupation astronaut an another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for 6 astronaut on the space station for 6 astronaut on the space station for 6 months will receive about 880,000 micro months will receive about 880,000 micro months will receive about 880,000 micro SS worth of radiation but not even they SS worth of radiation but not even they SS worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of are exposed to the highest levels of are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who ionizing radiation so can you guess who ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smoker's lungs a is the answer is a smoker's lungs a is the answer is a smoker's lungs a smoker's lungs on average receive smoker's lungs on average receive smoker's lungs on average receive 160,000 micro CS worth of radiation 160,000 micro CS worth of radiation 160,000 micro CS worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive every year that's due to the radioactive every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in The polonium and radioactive lead in The polonium and radioactive lead in The Tobacco that they're smoking so not only Tobacco that they're smoking so not only Tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and are they exposed to carcinogens and are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high toxins they also receive very high toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the levels of radiation so it's not the levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who radiation workers or even astronauts who radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing receive the highest doses of ionizing receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your radiation that honor goes to your radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few hey as you can see over the last few hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the months I've been traveling around the months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for world actually filming a documentary for world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle television it should be on in the middle television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like of next year but being in places like of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book The Day of the Triffids it's this book The Day of the Triffids it's this book The Day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic World in which about a post-apocalyptic World in which about a post-apocalyptic World in which plants take over I know it sounds like a plants take over I know it sounds like a plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out book
