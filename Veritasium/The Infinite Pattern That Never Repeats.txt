over 400 years ago in prague i'm now in prague and the in prague i'm now in prague and the in prague i'm now in prague and the czech republic which is perhaps my czech republic which is perhaps my czech republic which is perhaps my favorite european city that i've visited favorite european city that i've visited favorite european city that i've visited so far so far so far i'm going to visit the kepler museum i'm going to visit the kepler museum i'm going to visit the kepler museum because he's one of the most famous because he's one of the most famous because he's one of the most famous scientists who lived and worked around scientists who lived and worked around scientists who lived and worked around prague prague prague i want to tell you five things about i want to tell you five things about i want to tell you five things about johannes kepler johannes kepler johannes kepler that are essential to our story that are essential to our story that are essential to our story number one kepler is most famous for number one kepler is most famous for number one kepler is most famous for figuring out that the shapes of figuring out that the shapes of figuring out that the shapes of planetary orbits are planetary orbits are planetary orbits are ellipses but before he came to this ellipses but before he came to this ellipses but before he came to this realization realization realization he invented a model of the solar system he invented a model of the solar system he invented a model of the solar system in which the planets were on nested in which the planets were on nested in which the planets were on nested spheres spheres spheres separated by the platonic solids separated by the platonic solids separated by the platonic solids what are the platonic solids well they what are the platonic solids well they what are the platonic solids well they are objects where are objects where are objects where all of the faces are identical and all all of the faces are identical and all all of the faces are identical and all of the vertices of the vertices of the vertices are identical which means you can rotate are identical which means you can rotate are identical which means you can rotate them through some them through some them through some angle and they look the same as they did angle and they look the same as they did angle and they look the same as they did before before before so the cube is an obvious example then so the cube is an obvious example then so the cube is an obvious example then you also have you also have you also have the tetrahedron the octahedron the tetrahedron the octahedron the tetrahedron the octahedron the dodecahedron which has 12 pentagonal the dodecahedron which has 12 pentagonal the dodecahedron which has 12 pentagonal sides sides sides and the icosahedron which has 20 sides and the icosahedron which has 20 sides and the icosahedron which has 20 sides and that's it there are just five and that's it there are just five and that's it there are just five platonic solids platonic solids platonic solids which was convenient for kepler because which was convenient for kepler because which was convenient for kepler because in his day they only knew in his day they only knew in his day they only knew about six planets so this allowed him to about six planets so this allowed him to about six planets so this allowed him to put a unique platonic solid between put a unique platonic solid between put a unique platonic solid between each of the planetary spheres each of the planetary spheres each of the planetary spheres essentially he used them as spacers essentially he used them as spacers essentially he used them as spacers he carefully selected the order of the he carefully selected the order of the he carefully selected the order of the platonic solids platonic solids platonic solids so that the distances between planets so that the distances between planets so that the distances between planets would match astronomical observations as would match astronomical observations as would match astronomical observations as closely as possible closely as possible closely as possible he had this deep abiding belief that he had this deep abiding belief that he had this deep abiding belief that there was some geometric regularity in there was some geometric regularity in there was some geometric regularity in the universe the universe the universe and of course there is just not this and of course there is just not this and of course there is just not this two kepler's attraction to geometry two kepler's attraction to geometry two kepler's attraction to geometry extended to more practical questions extended to more practical questions extended to more practical questions like like like how do you stack cannonballs so they how do you stack cannonballs so they how do you stack cannonballs so they take up the least space on a ship's deck take up the least space on a ship's deck take up the least space on a ship's deck by 1611 kepler had an answer hexagonal by 1611 kepler had an answer hexagonal by 1611 kepler had an answer hexagonal close packing close packing close packing and the face centered cubic arrangement and the face centered cubic arrangement and the face centered cubic arrangement are both equivalently are both equivalently are both equivalently and optimally efficient with cannonballs and optimally efficient with cannonballs and optimally efficient with cannonballs occupying about 74 percent of the volume occupying about 74 percent of the volume occupying about 74 percent of the volume they take up they take up they take up now this might seem like the obvious way now this might seem like the obvious way now this might seem like the obvious way to stack spheres i mean it is the way to stack spheres i mean it is the way to stack spheres i mean it is the way that oranges that oranges that oranges are stacked in the supermarket but are stacked in the supermarket but are stacked in the supermarket but kepler hadn't proved it he just kepler hadn't proved it he just kepler hadn't proved it he just stated it as fact which is why this stated it as fact which is why this stated it as fact which is why this became known as kepler's conjecture became known as kepler's conjecture became known as kepler's conjecture now it turns out he was right but it now it turns out he was right but it now it turns out he was right but it took around took around took around 400 years to prove it the formal proof 400 years to prove it the formal proof 400 years to prove it the formal proof was only published in the journal form was only published in the journal form was only published in the journal form of mathematics of mathematics of mathematics in 2017. three in 2017. three in 2017. three kepler published his conjecture in a kepler published his conjecture in a kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet called deniva sexangula

begins to fall its initial formations invariably its initial formations invariably its initial formations invariably display the shape of a six cornered display the shape of a six cornered display the shape of a six cornered starlet starlet starlet for if it happens by chance why do they for if it happens by chance why do they for if it happens by chance why do they not fall just as well with five corners not fall just as well with five corners not fall just as well with five corners or with seven or with seven or with seven why always with six in kepler's day why always with six in kepler's day why always with six in kepler's day there was no real theory of atoms or there was no real theory of atoms or there was no real theory of atoms or molecules or how they self-arrange into molecules or how they self-arrange into molecules or how they self-arrange into crystals crystals crystals but kepler seemed to be on the verge of but kepler seemed to be on the verge of but kepler seemed to be on the verge of understanding this understanding this understanding this i mean he speculates about the smallest i mean he speculates about the smallest i mean he speculates about the smallest natural unit of a liquid like water natural unit of a liquid like water natural unit of a liquid like water essentially a water molecule and how essentially a water molecule and how essentially a water molecule and how these tiny units could these tiny units could these tiny units could stack together mechanically to form the stack together mechanically to form the stack together mechanically to form the hexagonal crystal hexagonal crystal hexagonal crystal not unlike the hexagonal close-packed not unlike the hexagonal close-packed not unlike the hexagonal close-packed cannonballs four kepler knew that regular hexagons four kepler knew that regular hexagons four kepler knew that regular hexagons can cover a flat surface perfectly with can cover a flat surface perfectly with can cover a flat surface perfectly with no gaps in mathematical jargon we say no gaps in mathematical jargon we say no gaps in mathematical jargon we say the hexagon tiles the plane the hexagon tiles the plane the hexagon tiles the plane periodically you know that a tiling is periodically you know that a tiling is periodically you know that a tiling is periodic periodic periodic if you can duplicate a portion of it and if you can duplicate a portion of it and if you can duplicate a portion of it and continue the pattern only through continue the pattern only through continue the pattern only through translation translation translation with no rotations or reflections with no rotations or reflections with no rotations or reflections periodic tilings can also have periodic tilings can also have periodic tilings can also have rotational symmetry rotational symmetry rotational symmetry a rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry a rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry a rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry because if you rotate it 180 degrees one because if you rotate it 180 degrees one because if you rotate it 180 degrees one half turn half turn half turn the pattern looks the same as it did the pattern looks the same as it did the pattern looks the same as it did before equilateral triangles have before equilateral triangles have before equilateral triangles have three-fold symmetry three-fold symmetry three-fold symmetry squares have four-fold symmetry and squares have four-fold symmetry and squares have four-fold symmetry and hexagons have six-fold symmetry but hexagons have six-fold symmetry but hexagons have six-fold symmetry but those those those are the only symmetries you can have two are the only symmetries you can have two are the only symmetries you can have two three four and six there is three four and six there is three four and six there is no fivefold symmetry regular pentagons no fivefold symmetry regular pentagons no fivefold symmetry regular pentagons do not tile the plane but that didn't do not tile the plane but that didn't do not tile the plane but that didn't stop kepler from trying stop kepler from trying stop kepler from trying see this pattern right here he published see this pattern right here he published see this pattern right here he published it in his book harmonics mundi or it in his book harmonics mundi or it in his book harmonics mundi or harmony of the world it has a certain harmony of the world it has a certain harmony of the world it has a certain five-fold symmetry five-fold symmetry five-fold symmetry but not exactly and it's not entirely but not exactly and it's not entirely but not exactly and it's not entirely clear clear clear how you would continue this pattern to how you would continue this pattern to how you would continue this pattern to tile the whole plane tile the whole plane tile the whole plane there are an infinite number of shapes there are an infinite number of shapes there are an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane periodically that can tile the plane periodically that can tile the plane periodically the regular hexagon can only tile the the regular hexagon can only tile the the regular hexagon can only tile the plane periodically plane periodically plane periodically there are also an infinite number of there are also an infinite number of there are also an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane shapes that can tile the plane shapes that can tile the plane periodically periodically periodically or non-periodically for example or non-periodically for example or non-periodically for example isosceles triangles can tile the plane isosceles triangles can tile the plane isosceles triangles can tile the plane periodically periodically periodically but if you rotate a pair of triangles but if you rotate a pair of triangles but if you rotate a pair of triangles well then the pattern is no longer well then the pattern is no longer well then the pattern is no longer perfectly periodic perfectly periodic perfectly periodic a sphinx tile can join with another a sphinx tile can join with another a sphinx tile can join with another rotate it at 180 degrees rotate it at 180 degrees rotate it at 180 degrees and tile the plane periodically but a and tile the plane periodically but a and tile the plane periodically but a different arrangement of these different arrangement of these different arrangement of these same tiles is non-periodic same tiles is non-periodic same tiles is non-periodic this raises the question are there some this raises the question are there some this raises the question are there some tiles that can tiles that can tiles that can only tile the plane non-periodically only tile the plane non-periodically only tile the plane non-periodically well in 1961 how wang was studying well in 1961 how wang was studying well in 1961 how wang was studying multi-colored square tiles the rules multi-colored square tiles the rules multi-colored square tiles the rules were were were touching edges must be the same color touching edges must be the same color touching edges must be the same color and you can't rotate or reflect tiles and you can't rotate or reflect tiles and you can't rotate or reflect tiles only slide them around now the question only slide them around now the question only slide them around now the question was was was if you're given a set of these tiles can if you're given a set of these tiles can if you're given a set of these tiles can you tell you tell you tell if they will tile the plane wang's if they will tile the plane wang's if they will tile the plane wang's conjecture conjecture conjecture was that if they can tile the plane well was that if they can tile the plane well was that if they can tile the plane well they can do so periodically they can do so periodically they can do so periodically but it turned out wang's conjecture was but it turned out wang's conjecture was but it turned out wang's conjecture was false false false his student robert berger found a set of his student robert berger found a set of his student robert berger found a set of 426 tiles that could tile the plane 426 tiles that could tile the plane 426 tiles that could tile the plane but only non-periodically but only non-periodically but only non-periodically think about that for a second here we think about that for a second here we think about that for a second here we have a finite set of tiles okay it's a have a finite set of tiles okay it's a have a finite set of tiles okay it's a large number large number large number but it's finite and it can tile all the but it's finite and it can tile all the but it's finite and it can tile all the way out to infinity way out to infinity way out to infinity without ever repeating the same pattern without ever repeating the same pattern without ever repeating the same pattern there's no way even to force them to there's no way even to force them to there's no way even to force them to tile periodically tile periodically tile periodically and a set of tiles like this that can and a set of tiles like this that can and a set of tiles like this that can only tile the plane only tile the plane only tile the plane non-periodically is called an aperiodic non-periodically is called an aperiodic non-periodically is called an aperiodic tiling tiling tiling and mathematicians wanted to know were and mathematicians wanted to know were and mathematicians wanted to know were there aperiodic tilings that required there aperiodic tilings that required there aperiodic tilings that required fewer tiles well robert berger himself fewer tiles well robert berger himself fewer tiles well robert berger himself found a set with only 104 donald knuth found a set with only 104 donald knuth found a set with only 104 donald knuth got the number down to 92 got the number down to 92 got the number down to 92 and then in 1969 you had raphael and then in 1969 you had raphael and then in 1969 you had raphael robinson who came up with robinson who came up with robinson who came up with six tiles just six that could tile the six tiles just six that could tile the six tiles just six that could tile the entire plane without ever repeating entire plane without ever repeating entire plane without ever repeating then along came roger penrose who would then along came roger penrose who would then along came roger penrose who would ultimately get the number down to two penrose started with a pentagon he added penrose started with a pentagon he added penrose started with a pentagon he added other pentagons around it other pentagons around it other pentagons around it and of course noticed the gaps but this and of course noticed the gaps but this and of course noticed the gaps but this new shape new shape new shape could fit within a larger pentagon which could fit within a larger pentagon which could fit within a larger pentagon which gave penrose an idea what if he took the gave penrose an idea what if he took the gave penrose an idea what if he took the original pentagons original pentagons original pentagons and broke them into smaller pentagons and broke them into smaller pentagons and broke them into smaller pentagons well now some of the gaps start well now some of the gaps start well now some of the gaps start connecting up into connecting up into connecting up into rhombus shapes other gaps have three rhombus shapes other gaps have three rhombus shapes other gaps have three spikes spikes spikes but penrose didn't stop there he but penrose didn't stop there he but penrose didn't stop there he subdivided the pentagons again subdivided the pentagons again subdivided the pentagons again now some of the gaps are large enough now some of the gaps are large enough now some of the gaps are large enough that you can use pentagons to fill in that you can use pentagons to fill in that you can use pentagons to fill in part of them part of them part of them and the remaining holes you're left with and the remaining holes you're left with and the remaining holes you're left with are just rhombuses are just rhombuses are just rhombuses stars and a fraction of a star that stars and a fraction of a star that stars and a fraction of a star that penrose calls a justice cap penrose calls a justice cap penrose calls a justice cap you can keep subdividing indefinitely you can keep subdividing indefinitely you can keep subdividing indefinitely and you will only ever find and you will only ever find and you will only ever find these shapes so with just these pieces these shapes so with just these pieces these shapes so with just these pieces you can tile the plane you can tile the plane you can tile the plane aperiodically with an almost five-fold aperiodically with an almost five-fold aperiodically with an almost five-fold symmetry symmetry symmetry the fifth thing about johannes kepler is the fifth thing about johannes kepler is the fifth thing about johannes kepler is that if you take his pentagon pattern that if you take his pentagon pattern that if you take his pentagon pattern and you overlay it on top of penrose's and you overlay it on top of penrose's and you overlay it on top of penrose's the two match up perfectly the two match up perfectly the two match up perfectly [Music] [Music] [Music] once penrose had his pattern he found once penrose had his pattern he found once penrose had his pattern he found ways to simplify the tiles ways to simplify the tiles ways to simplify the tiles he distilled the geometry down to just he distilled the geometry down to just he distilled the geometry down to just two tiles a thick rhombus two tiles a thick rhombus two tiles a thick rhombus and a thin rhombus the rules for how and a thin rhombus the rules for how and a thin rhombus the rules for how they can come together can be enforced they can come together can be enforced they can come together can be enforced by bumps and notches by bumps and notches by bumps and notches or by matching colors and the rules or by matching colors and the rules or by matching colors and the rules ensure that these ensure that these ensure that these two single tiles can only tile the plane two single tiles can only tile the plane two single tiles can only tile the plane non-periodically non-periodically non-periodically just two tiles go all the way out to just two tiles go all the way out to just two tiles go all the way out to infinity without infinity without infinity without ever repeating now one way to see this ever repeating now one way to see this ever repeating now one way to see this is to print up two copies of the same is to print up two copies of the same is to print up two copies of the same penrose pattern penrose pattern penrose pattern and one on a transparency and overlay and one on a transparency and overlay and one on a transparency and overlay them on top of each other them on top of each other them on top of each other now the resulting interference you get now the resulting interference you get now the resulting interference you get is called a moire is called a moire is called a moire pattern where it is dark the patterns pattern where it is dark the patterns pattern where it is dark the patterns are are are not aligned you can see there are not aligned you can see there are not aligned you can see there are also some light spots and that's where also some light spots and that's where also some light spots and that's where the patterns do the patterns do the patterns do match up and as i rotate around you can match up and as i rotate around you can match up and as i rotate around you can see the see the see the light spots move in and get smaller and light spots move in and get smaller and light spots move in and get smaller and then at a certain point then at a certain point then at a certain point they move out and get bigger they move out and get bigger they move out and get bigger and what i want to do is try to enlarge and what i want to do is try to enlarge and what i want to do is try to enlarge one of these bright spots one of these bright spots one of these bright spots and see how big of a matching section i and see how big of a matching section i and see how big of a matching section i can find can find can find oh yes yes it's like oh yes yes it's like oh yes yes it's like all of a sudden everything is all of a sudden everything is all of a sudden everything is illuminated i love it so these patterns are perfectly matching so these patterns are perfectly matching so these patterns are perfectly matching up here here here here and here but up here here here here and here but up here here here here and here but not along these radial lines not along these radial lines not along these radial lines and that is why they look dark so what and that is why they look dark so what and that is why they look dark so what this shows us this shows us this shows us is that you can't ever match any section is that you can't ever match any section is that you can't ever match any section perfectly to one perfectly to one perfectly to one beneath it there will always be some beneath it there will always be some beneath it there will always be some difference difference difference so my favorite penrose pattern is so my favorite penrose pattern is so my favorite penrose pattern is actually made out of actually made out of actually made out of these two shapes which are called kites these two shapes which are called kites these two shapes which are called kites and darts and they have these very and darts and they have these very and darts and they have these very particular angles particular angles particular angles and the way they're meant to match up is and the way they're meant to match up is and the way they're meant to match up is based on these two curves you can see based on these two curves you can see based on these two curves you can see there's a curve on each piece there's a curve on each piece there's a curve on each piece and so you have to connect them so that and so you have to connect them so that and so you have to connect them so that the curves are continuous the curves are continuous the curves are continuous and that's the rule that allows you to and that's the rule that allows you to and that's the rule that allows you to build an aperiodic tiling from these two build an aperiodic tiling from these two build an aperiodic tiling from these two pieces pieces pieces so uh i laser cut thousands so uh i laser cut thousands so uh i laser cut thousands of these pieces and oh i'm gonna of these pieces and oh i'm gonna of these pieces and oh i'm gonna try to put them together and make a huge try to put them together and make a huge try to put them together and make a huge penrose oh man penrose oh man penrose oh man come on if you stare at a pattern of kites and if you stare at a pattern of kites and if you stare at a pattern of kites and darts you'll start to notice all kinds darts you'll start to notice all kinds darts you'll start to notice all kinds of of of regularities like stars and suns regularities like stars and suns regularities like stars and suns but look closer and they don't quite but look closer and they don't quite but look closer and they don't quite repeat in the way you'd expect them to these two tiles create an ever-changing these two tiles create an ever-changing these two tiles create an ever-changing pattern that extends out to infinity pattern that extends out to infinity pattern that extends out to infinity without repeating does this mean without repeating does this mean without repeating does this mean there is only one pattern of kites and there is only one pattern of kites and there is only one pattern of kites and darts darts darts and every picture that we see is just a and every picture that we see is just a and every picture that we see is just a portion portion portion of that overall singular pattern of that overall singular pattern of that overall singular pattern well the answer is no there are actually well the answer is no there are actually well the answer is no there are actually an uncountably infinite number of an uncountably infinite number of an uncountably infinite number of different patterns of kites and darts different patterns of kites and darts different patterns of kites and darts that tile the entire plane that tile the entire plane that tile the entire plane and it gets weirder if you were on any and it gets weirder if you were on any and it gets weirder if you were on any of those tilings of those tilings of those tilings you wouldn't be able to tell which one you wouldn't be able to tell which one you wouldn't be able to tell which one it is it is it is i mean you might try to look further and i mean you might try to look further and i mean you might try to look further and further out gather more and more data further out gather more and more data further out gather more and more data but but but it's futile because any finite region it's futile because any finite region it's futile because any finite region of one of these tilings appears of one of these tilings appears of one of these tilings appears infinitely many times infinitely many times infinitely many times in all of the other versions of those in all of the other versions of those in all of the other versions of those tilings tilings tilings i mean don't get me wrong those tilings i mean don't get me wrong those tilings i mean don't get me wrong those tilings are also different in are also different in are also different in an infinite number of ways but it's an infinite number of ways but it's an infinite number of ways but it's impossible to tell that unless you could impossible to tell that unless you could impossible to tell that unless you could see the whole pattern see the whole pattern see the whole pattern which is impossible there's this kind of paradox to penrose there's this kind of paradox to penrose there's this kind of paradox to penrose tilings tilings tilings where there's an uncountable infinity where there's an uncountable infinity where there's an uncountable infinity of different versions but just by of different versions but just by of different versions but just by looking at them looking at them looking at them you could never tell them apart now what if we count up all the kites now what if we count up all the kites now what if we count up all the kites and darts in this pattern and darts in this pattern and darts in this pattern well i get 440 kites and 272 well i get 440 kites and 272 well i get 440 kites and 272 darts does that ratio ring any bells darts does that ratio ring any bells darts does that ratio ring any bells well if you divide one by the other you well if you divide one by the other you well if you divide one by the other you get 1.618 get 1.618 get 1.618 that is the golden ratio that is the golden ratio that is the golden ratio so why does the golden ratio appear in so why does the golden ratio appear in so why does the golden ratio appear in this pattern this pattern this pattern well as you know it contains a kind of well as you know it contains a kind of well as you know it contains a kind of five-fold symmetry five-fold symmetry five-fold symmetry and of all the irrational constants the and of all the irrational constants the and of all the irrational constants the golden ratio golden ratio golden ratio phi is the most five-ish of the phi is the most five-ish of the phi is the most five-ish of the constants i mean you can express the constants i mean you can express the constants i mean you can express the golden ratio as golden ratio as golden ratio as 0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5 0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5 0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5 times 0.5 the golden ratio is also times 0.5 the golden ratio is also times 0.5 the golden ratio is also heavily associated with pentagons heavily associated with pentagons heavily associated with pentagons i mean the ratio of the diagonal to an i mean the ratio of the diagonal to an i mean the ratio of the diagonal to an edge edge edge is the golden ratio and the kite and is the golden ratio and the kite and is the golden ratio and the kite and dart pieces themselves dart pieces themselves dart pieces themselves are actually sections of pentagons same are actually sections of pentagons same are actually sections of pentagons same with the rhombuses with the rhombuses with the rhombuses so they actually have the golden ratio so they actually have the golden ratio so they actually have the golden ratio built right built right built right into their construction the fact that into their construction the fact that into their construction the fact that the ratio of kites to darts approaches the ratio of kites to darts approaches the ratio of kites to darts approaches the golden ratio an irrational number the golden ratio an irrational number the golden ratio an irrational number provides evidence that the pattern can't provides evidence that the pattern can't provides evidence that the pattern can't possibly be periodic possibly be periodic possibly be periodic if the pattern were periodic then the if the pattern were periodic then the if the pattern were periodic then the ratio of kites to darts ratio of kites to darts ratio of kites to darts could be expressed as a ratio of two could be expressed as a ratio of two could be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers whole numbers whole numbers the number of kites to darts in each the number of kites to darts in each the number of kites to darts in each periodic segment periodic segment periodic segment and it goes deeper if you draw on the and it goes deeper if you draw on the and it goes deeper if you draw on the tiles tiles tiles not curves but these particular straight not curves but these particular straight not curves but these particular straight lines lines lines well now when you put the pattern well now when you put the pattern well now when you put the pattern together you see something interesting together you see something interesting together you see something interesting they all connect up perfectly into they all connect up perfectly into they all connect up perfectly into straight lines straight lines straight lines there are five sets of parallel lines there are five sets of parallel lines there are five sets of parallel lines this is a kind of proof of the five-fold this is a kind of proof of the five-fold this is a kind of proof of the five-fold symmetry of the pattern symmetry of the pattern symmetry of the pattern but it is not perfectly regular but it is not perfectly regular but it is not perfectly regular take a look at any one set of parallel take a look at any one set of parallel take a look at any one set of parallel lines you'll notice lines you'll notice lines you'll notice there are two different spacings call there are two different spacings call there are two different spacings call them long and short them long and short them long and short from the bottom we have long short long from the bottom we have long short long from the bottom we have long short long short long short long short long long wait that breaks the pattern long wait that breaks the pattern long wait that breaks the pattern these gaps don't follow a periodic these gaps don't follow a periodic these gaps don't follow a periodic pattern either pattern either pattern either but count up the number of longs and but count up the number of longs and but count up the number of longs and shorts in any section shorts in any section shorts in any section here i get 13 shorts and 21 longs here i get 13 shorts and 21 longs here i get 13 shorts and 21 longs and you have the fibonacci sequence and you have the fibonacci sequence and you have the fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 and so on and the ratio of 34 and so on and the ratio of 34 and so on and the ratio of one fibonacci number to the previous one one fibonacci number to the previous one one fibonacci number to the previous one approaches approaches approaches the golden ratio now the question penrose faced from now the question penrose faced from now the question penrose faced from other scientists was other scientists was other scientists was could there be a physical analog for could there be a physical analog for could there be a physical analog for these patterns these patterns these patterns do they occur in nature perhaps in do they occur in nature perhaps in do they occur in nature perhaps in crystal structure crystal structure crystal structure penrose thought that was unlikely the penrose thought that was unlikely the penrose thought that was unlikely the very nature of a crystal is that it is very nature of a crystal is that it is very nature of a crystal is that it is made up of repeating units made up of repeating units made up of repeating units just as the fundamental symmetries of just as the fundamental symmetries of just as the fundamental symmetries of the shapes that tile the plane had been the shapes that tile the plane had been the shapes that tile the plane had been worked out much worked out much worked out much earlier the basic unit cells that earlier the basic unit cells that earlier the basic unit cells that compose compose compose all crystals were well established there all crystals were well established there all crystals were well established there are 14 of them are 14 of them are 14 of them and no one had ever seen a crystal that and no one had ever seen a crystal that and no one had ever seen a crystal that failed to fit failed to fit failed to fit one of these patterns and there was one of these patterns and there was one of these patterns and there was another problem another problem another problem crystals are built by putting atoms and crystals are built by putting atoms and crystals are built by putting atoms and molecules together molecules together molecules together locally whereas penrose tilings well locally whereas penrose tilings well locally whereas penrose tilings well they seem to require some sort of they seem to require some sort of they seem to require some sort of long range coordination take this long range coordination take this long range coordination take this pattern for example pattern for example pattern for example you could put a dart over here you could put a dart over here you could put a dart over here and continue to tile out to infinity no and continue to tile out to infinity no and continue to tile out to infinity no problems problems problems or you could put a kite or you could put a kite or you could put a kite over here on the other side again no over here on the other side again no over here on the other side again no problems problems problems but if you place the kite but if you place the kite but if you place the kite and dart in here simultaneously and dart in here simultaneously and dart in here simultaneously well then this pattern will not work well then this pattern will not work well then this pattern will not work i mean you can keep tiling for a while i mean you can keep tiling for a while i mean you can keep tiling for a while but when you get to somewhere around but when you get to somewhere around but when you get to somewhere around here here here well it's not gonna work you can put a well it's not gonna work you can put a well it's not gonna work you can put a dart in there which completes the dart in there which completes the dart in there which completes the pattern nicely but then you get this pattern nicely but then you get this pattern nicely but then you get this really awkward shape there which is really awkward shape there which is really awkward shape there which is actually the shape of another dart actually the shape of another dart actually the shape of another dart but if you put that one in there then but if you put that one in there then but if you put that one in there then the the the lines don't match up the pattern doesn't lines don't match up the pattern doesn't lines don't match up the pattern doesn't work so how could this work as a crystal work so how could this work as a crystal work so how could this work as a crystal i mean both of these tiles obey the i mean both of these tiles obey the i mean both of these tiles obey the local rules local rules local rules but in the long term they just don't but in the long term they just don't but in the long term they just don't work in the early 1980s work in the early 1980s work in the early 1980s paul steinhardt and his students were paul steinhardt and his students were paul steinhardt and his students were using computers to model how atoms come using computers to model how atoms come using computers to model how atoms come together into condensed matter together into condensed matter together into condensed matter that is essentially solid material at that is essentially solid material at that is essentially solid material at the smallest scales the smallest scales the smallest scales and he found that locally they like to and he found that locally they like to and he found that locally they like to form icosahedrons form icosahedrons form icosahedrons but this was known to be the most but this was known to be the most but this was known to be the most forbidden shape because it is full forbidden shape because it is full forbidden shape because it is full of five-fold symmetries so the question of five-fold symmetries so the question of five-fold symmetries so the question they posed was they posed was they posed was how big can these zykosahedrons get they how big can these zykosahedrons get they how big can these zykosahedrons get they thought maybe 10 atoms or thought maybe 10 atoms or thought maybe 10 atoms or 100 atoms but inspired by penrose 100 atoms but inspired by penrose 100 atoms but inspired by penrose tilings tilings tilings they designed a new kind of structure a they designed a new kind of structure a they designed a new kind of structure a 3d analog of penrose tilings now known 3d analog of penrose tilings now known 3d analog of penrose tilings now known as a quasi-crystal as a quasi-crystal as a quasi-crystal and they simulated how x-rays would and they simulated how x-rays would and they simulated how x-rays would diffract off such a structure diffract off such a structure diffract off such a structure and they found a pattern with rings of and they found a pattern with rings of and they found a pattern with rings of 10 points reflecting the five-fold 10 points reflecting the five-fold 10 points reflecting the five-fold symmetry symmetry symmetry just a few hundred kilometers away just a few hundred kilometers away just a few hundred kilometers away completely unaware of their work another completely unaware of their work another completely unaware of their work another scientist dan scientist dan scientist dan schechtman created this flaky material schechtman created this flaky material schechtman created this flaky material from from from aluminum and manganese and when he aluminum and manganese and when he aluminum and manganese and when he scattered electrons off his material scattered electrons off his material scattered electrons off his material this is the picture he got it this is the picture he got it this is the picture he got it almost perfectly matches the one made by almost perfectly matches the one made by almost perfectly matches the one made by steinhardt so if penrose tilings require long so if penrose tilings require long so if penrose tilings require long range coordination then how do you range coordination then how do you range coordination then how do you possibly make possibly make possibly make quasi crystals well i was talking to quasi crystals well i was talking to quasi crystals well i was talking to paul steinhardt about this and he told paul steinhardt about this and he told paul steinhardt about this and he told me me me if you just use the matching rules on if you just use the matching rules on if you just use the matching rules on the edges the edges the edges those rules are not strong enough and if those rules are not strong enough and if those rules are not strong enough and if you apply them locally you run into you apply them locally you run into you apply them locally you run into problems like this you misplace problems like this you misplace problems like this you misplace tiles but he said if you have rules for tiles but he said if you have rules for tiles but he said if you have rules for the vertices the way the vertices can the vertices the way the vertices can the vertices the way the vertices can connect with each other those rules are connect with each other those rules are connect with each other those rules are strong enough strong enough strong enough locally so that you never make a mistake locally so that you never make a mistake locally so that you never make a mistake and the pattern and the pattern and the pattern can go on to infinity one of the seminal can go on to infinity one of the seminal can
