WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Do not hit the like button! Or the dislike button,&nbsp;at least not yet. I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math&nbsp;and philosophy over the past 20 years. There is no consensus answer. So I want you to listen to the&nbsp;problem and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons. Okay, here is&nbsp;the setup: Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment. And before it starts&nbsp;she's informed of the procedure. On Sunday night she will be put to sleep. And then a fair coin will&nbsp; be flipped. If that coin comes up heads, she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep. If&nbsp;the coin comes up Tails she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep. But then she will&nbsp;be awakened on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep. Now each time she gets put back to sleep&nbsp; she will forget that she was ever awakened. In the brief period anytime she's awake she will be told&nbsp; no information. But she'll be asked one question: What do you believe is the probability that the&nbsp; coin came up heads? so how should she answer? Feel free to pause the video and answer the question&nbsp; for yourself right now. This was my reaction after hearing the problem for the first time. I mean the&nbsp;intuitive answer that pops into my head is clearly one in three. It could be the Monday when it came&nbsp;up heads. Or it could be the Monday when it came up Tails. Or it could be the Tuesday when it came&nbsp; up Tails. But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a&nbsp;coin coming up heads is one-third. I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is&nbsp; asked of her. What is the probability that a Fair coin flipped gives heads? That's 50 percent. What is the&nbsp;probability that the coin came up heads? I would say the answer is a third from her perspective. Yeah it's it's remarkably the same question. The simple reason why Sleeping Beauty should say&nbsp; the probability of heads is one half is because she knows the coin is fair. Nothing changes between&nbsp; when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up and she knew for a fact that she would be woken up and&nbsp; she receives no new information when that happens. Imagine that instead of flipping the coin&nbsp; after she's asleep, the experimenters flip&nbsp;&nbsp; the coin first and ask her immediately: "what's the&nbsp; probability that the coin came up heads?" Well she would certainly say one half so why should&nbsp; anything change after she goes to sleep and&nbsp;&nbsp;wakes up This is known as the Halfer position.&nbsp; But there is another way to look at it. Others would argue that something does change when she's&nbsp; awakened. I mean it seems like she gets no new information. There are no calendars no one tells&nbsp; her anything and she knew that she would be woken up. But she actually learns something important. She&nbsp;learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states. The coin came&nbsp;up either heads or tails to existing in a reality where there are three possible states: Monday heads,&nbsp;Monday Tails or Tuesday tails. And therefore she should assign equal probability to each of these&nbsp;three outcomes where Heads only occurred in one. So the probability that the coin came up heads is&nbsp;one-third. This is known as the thirder position Now I know it seems wrong to suggest that a Fair&nbsp; coin should have a one-third probability of coming&nbsp;&nbsp; up heads but that's because the question she's&nbsp; asked is subtly different. The implied question&nbsp;&nbsp; is: "Given you're awake, what's the probability that&nbsp; the coin came up heads?" And that is one-third Now halfers would counter that just because there are&nbsp; three possible outcomes doesn't mean they are each&nbsp;&nbsp; equally likely. In the Monty Hall problem for&nbsp; example the contestant ultimately has to choose&nbsp;&nbsp; between two doors. But it'd be wrong to assign&nbsp; them 50/50 odds. The prize is actually twice&nbsp;&nbsp; as likely to be behind one door than the other. In the Sleeping Beauty problem we know a heads outcome and a Tails outcome are equally likely. So the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is 50 percent And the chance of waking up on Monday or&nbsp; Tuesday with Tails should be 50 percent. Therefore the Tails probability gets split across two days 25&nbsp;percent each. but if you repeat the experiment over and over, which you can try for yourself by repeatedly&nbsp;flipping a coin, you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads, a third of the time Monday&nbsp;tails, and a third of the time Tuesday tails, not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest. So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked "What's the probability&nbsp;the coin came up heads?" What would you say? If you would say one-third then hit the like&nbsp;button. If you would say one half, hit the dislike button. The answer may seem obvious to you but you&nbsp;should know that to other people the other answer seems equally obvious. And that's why hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds of philosophy papers have been published on this problem over the past 22 years. There have&nbsp;been many variations of this problem like what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands&nbsp; tails she's instead woken up a million times? If the coin comes up heads she's still woken only&nbsp; once. Doesn't it seem absurd in this case, when Sleeping Beauty wakes up, to say that it was just&nbsp; as likely that a coin landed heads as tails? When we know there are a million more wakeups in the&nbsp; tails case than in the heads case. I mean if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million&nbsp;black marbles, what are the chances that you pull out that one white marble? I was pretty convinced&nbsp; by this and I considered myself a thirder but this same argument is used to convince people that&nbsp; we're living in a simulation. The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so&nbsp;dramatically, even over just the last 40 years, that we can imagine a time in the not-too-distant&nbsp; future when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world. And once that occurs it&nbsp; should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation. And then if you were to ask someone if&nbsp; they're living in a simulation, they would have to admit that they probably are because there are&nbsp;many more instances of that existence than the one true external reality. But how do we know that&nbsp; this hasn't happened already and that we're living inside a simulation? I mean if it can happen then&nbsp; it probably has happened and we are living in a simulation This seems like the logical conclusion&nbsp; of the third or world view. Now I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation and I think&nbsp;most people don't buy it. But maybe that's just illogical bias. But there's another thought&nbsp;experiment that makes me seriously reconsider the third or position. Let's say there's a soccer&nbsp; game between a really great team like Brazil and a less World dominating team like Canada. So the&nbsp;odds are 80:20 in Brazil's favor now a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game&nbsp; starts. And if Brazil wins they'll wake you up one time But if Canada wins they'll wake you up 30&nbsp; times in a row and just like Sleeping Beauty you won't remember if you've been woken before. Okay&nbsp;so the game is about to start you fall asleep... and now you're woken up. Who do you think won the&nbsp; game? The thirder would say Canada but I would almost certainly say Brazil. I mean why should I&nbsp; give any weight to what the researcher would have&nbsp;&nbsp; done if Canada had one when I'm fairly confident&nbsp; that they won't? To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times and we do this experiment&nbsp;each time. Well then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up you'll probably be right about&nbsp;four out of five of the games. but if you said Canada every time you would be wrong about those&nbsp;four games but right 30 times in a row when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; repeatedly asked about Canada's one victory. If&nbsp; you stand to win a bet by correctly answering&nbsp;&nbsp; the question then by all means you should bet&nbsp; on Canada. But if you want to correctly pick the&nbsp;&nbsp; winner of more of the games well then you should&nbsp; say Brazil. And this is what's at the heart of the&nbsp;&nbsp; dispute between Halfers and Thirders in the Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty problem. If you want to be right about the&nbsp;&nbsp; outcome of the coin tosses well you should say the&nbsp; probability of heads is a half but if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp; answer more questionings correctly well then you&nbsp; should say one-third. I want to leave you with one&nbsp;&nbsp; last thought experiment. Imagine that you know for&nbsp; a fact that before our universe began there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a coin flip and if it came up heads only a single&nbsp; Universe would be created. But if it came up Tails&nbsp;&nbsp; a quasi-infinite Multiverse would be created and&nbsp; in each of those Multiverse universes you'd find&nbsp;&nbsp; every possible variation of Earth and the people&nbsp; on it In some versions there would be no Earth Now you becoming conscious is just like Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty waking up. There's no way to tell if&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in that single universe or in one of the&nbsp; Multiverse universes but you know there are a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; more of them. So would you think that you're for&nbsp; sure in the Multiverse. Or are the chances 50/50? The best way to develop intuition about&nbsp; probability is by working through scenarios&nbsp;&nbsp; or running simulations like we did for Sleeping&nbsp; Beauty.
