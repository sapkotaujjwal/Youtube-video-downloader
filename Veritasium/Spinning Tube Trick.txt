WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] check this out I have a piece of PVC check this out I have a piece of PVC check this out I have a piece of PVC electrical conduit and on one end I've electrical conduit and on one end I've electrical conduit and on one end I've labeled an O and the other end I've labeled an O and the other end I've labeled an O and the other end I've labeled an X now I'm going to put it on labeled an X now I'm going to put it on labeled an X now I'm going to put it on the table and press down with my the table and press down with my the table and press down with my forefinger on the o and I'm going to forefinger on the o and I'm going to forefinger on the o and I'm going to give it a give it a give it a [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] spin do you see that you can only see spin do you see that you can only see spin do you see that you can only see the O as it spins around let's make sure the O as it spins around let's make sure the O as it spins around let's make sure that's not just a fluke I'll try it that's not just a fluke I'll try it that's not just a fluke I'll try it again so putting my finger on the again so putting my finger on the again so putting my finger on the o and I see only O's well let's try and I see only O's well let's try and I see only O's well let's try putting my finger on the X and see what putting my finger on the X and see what putting my finger on the X and see what we see then and we see only X's so why is that then and we see only X's so why is that then and we see only X's so why is that why do you only see the label of the why do you only see the label of the why do you only see the label of the side that you side that you side that you press well I don't want to tell you the press well I don't want to tell you the press well I don't want to tell you the answer right away you could Google it answer right away you could Google it answer right away you could Google it but I don't think that would be very but I don't think that would be very but I don't think that would be very satisfying so I think the best way would satisfying so I think the best way would satisfying so I think the best way would be to go down to your local hardware be to go down to your local hardware be to go down to your local hardware shop pick pick up a bit of a electrical shop pick pick up a bit of a electrical shop pick pick up a bit of a electrical conduit and cut it into various conduit and cut it into various conduit and cut it into various lengths now to help you out I have made lengths now to help you out I have made lengths now to help you out I have made a shorter length of tubing with the same a shorter length of tubing with the same a shorter length of tubing with the same markings on it so let's give that one a markings on it so let's give that one a markings on it so let's give that one a try and see how it Compares so first try and see how it Compares so first try and see how it Compares so first I'll press on the I'll press on the I'll press on the o we see three O's when I do it like o we see three O's when I do it like o we see three O's when I do it like that right but you don't see the X's that right but you don't see the X's that right but you don't see the X's yeah but if you put your finger on the X yeah but if you put your finger on the X yeah but if you put your finger on the X to start with you see 3 X's that's interesting so with you see 3 X's that's interesting so with you see 3 X's that's interesting so what's the deal what's the deal what's the deal yeah what is the deal if you like send yeah what is the deal if you like send yeah what is the deal if you like send me in a video response and I'll post it me in a video response and I'll post it me in a video response and I'll post it below now if you're too lazy for any of below now if you're too lazy for any of below now if you're too lazy for any of that I'll post the answer in a week so that I'll post the answer in a week so that I'll post the answer in a week so you know subscribe and you'll find out you know subscribe and you'll find out you know subscribe and you'll find out why this happens so normally when I'm filming my happens so normally when I'm filming my happens so normally when I'm filming my videos I have to approach people and ask videos I have to approach people and ask videos I have to approach people and ask them to talk to me about physics but them to talk to me about physics but them to talk to me about physics but while I was filming the spinning tube while I was filming the spinning tube while I was filming the spinning tube trick uh a few kids came up to me and trick uh a few kids came up to me and trick uh a few kids came up to me and wanted to see what I was doing and we wanted to see what I was doing and we wanted to see what I was doing and we got to discussing how the trick works got to discussing how the trick works got to discussing how the trick works and one of the kids suggested that I try and one of the kids suggested that I try and one of the kids suggested that I try spinning the tube on a glass table now a spinning the tube on a glass table now a spinning the tube on a glass table now a glass table is beyond the budget of glass table is beyond the budget of glass table is beyond the budget of veritasium but a piece of glass resting veritasium but a piece of glass resting veritasium but a piece of glass resting precariously on the backs of two chairs precariously on the backs of two chairs precariously on the backs of two chairs that I think I can manage if this was that I think I can manage if this was that I think I can manage if this was glass and you clicked on the X and we glass and you clicked on the X and we glass and you clicked on the X and we were looking From Below you'd see the were looking From Below you'd see the were looking From Below you'd see the you're hectic jar I reckon you'd still you're hectic jar I reckon you'd still you're hectic jar I reckon you'd still see the X's I reckon you still I don't see the X's I reckon you still I don't see the X's I reckon you still I don't know but I mean I reckon you still see know but I mean I reckon you still see know but I mean I reckon you still see good question next video this is the good question next video this is the good question next video this is the next video we need next video we need next video we need to now instead of saving this for to now instead of saving this for to now instead of saving this for another episode I thought I would do it another episode I thought I would do it another episode I thought I would do it right now and that way you may have a right now and that way you may have a right now and that way you may have a little bit more evidence to figure out little bit more evidence to figure out little bit more evidence to figure out how the trick is working so I'm going to how the trick is working so I'm going to how the trick is working so I'm going to place the tube on the glass surface and place the tube on the glass surface and place the tube on the glass surface and I'm going to press down on the X and I I'm going to press down on the X and I I'm going to press down on the X and I want you to make a prediction if we look want you to make a prediction if we look want you to make a prediction if we look from the underside from underneath the from the underside from underneath the from the underside from underneath the glass what will we see will we see an O glass what will we see will we see an O glass what will we see will we see an O like the student thought will we see an like the student thought will we see an like the student thought will we see an X like I said we would will we see both X like I said we would will we see both X like I said we would will we see both the X and the o or will we see the X and the o or will we see the X and the o or will we see neither so I want you to make a neither so I want you to make a neither so I want you to make a prediction now click on one of the an prediction now click on one of the an prediction now click on one of the an ations if you're watching on YouTube if ations if you're watching on YouTube if ations if you're watching on YouTube if you're watching on a mobile device I'll you're watching on a mobile device I'll you're watching on a mobile device I'll put the link in the description so put the link in the description so put the link in the description so hopefully you can check that out let's hopefully you can check that out let's hopefully you can check that out let's give it a shot so make your prediction give it a shot so make your prediction give it a shot so make your prediction now 3 2
