WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] previously on veritasium we saw how our previously on veritasium we saw how our previously on veritasium we saw how our understanding of light has changed over understanding of light has changed over understanding of light has changed over the centuries in the late 1600s hyans the centuries in the late 1600s hyans the centuries in the late 1600s hyans proposed that light was a type of wave proposed that light was a type of wave proposed that light was a type of wave while Newton considered it a stream of while Newton considered it a stream of while Newton considered it a stream of particles this debate appeared to be particles this debate appeared to be particles this debate appeared to be settled in 1801 by Young's double slit settled in 1801 by Young's double slit settled in 1801 by Young's double slit experiment which showed light passing experiment which showed light passing experiment which showed light passing through two slits produced patterns like through two slits produced patterns like through two slits produced patterns like water waves but by 1900 it was clear water waves but by 1900 it was clear water waves but by 1900 it was clear that light energy was not evenly that light energy was not evenly that light energy was not evenly distributed as expected for a wave distributed as expected for a wave distributed as expected for a wave rather on the smallest scales it comes rather on the smallest scales it comes rather on the smallest scales it comes in lumps called Quant or photons so the in lumps called Quant or photons so the in lumps called Quant or photons so the question is how does this affect the question is how does this affect the question is how does this affect the double slit experiment here I have a double slit experiment here I have a double slit experiment here I have a more contained double slit experiment more contained double slit experiment more contained double slit experiment where there is a laser which fires a where there is a laser which fires a where there is a laser which fires a beam through a single slit then through beam through a single slit then through beam through a single slit then through a double slit and onto a screen where a double slit and onto a screen where a double slit and onto a screen where you can see a well-defined interference you can see a well-defined interference you can see a well-defined interference pattern there's a series of bright and pattern there's a series of bright and pattern there's a series of bright and dark bands which are much easier to dark bands which are much easier to dark bands which are much easier to observe than when I use sunlight because observe than when I use sunlight because observe than when I use sunlight because with only one wavelength there are no with only one wavelength there are no with only one wavelength there are no other colors involved this is what a other colors involved this is what a other colors involved this is what a graph of intensity versus position would graph of intensity versus position would graph of intensity versus position would look like for the interference pattern look like for the interference pattern look like for the interference pattern what creates that pattern P consider the what creates that pattern P consider the what creates that pattern P consider the bright spot in the middle the light from bright spot in the middle the light from bright spot in the middle the light from each slit has to travel the same each slit has to travel the same each slit has to travel the same distance to reach that point and hence distance to reach that point and hence distance to reach that point and hence both waves arrive in Phase that means both waves arrive in Phase that means both waves arrive in Phase that means crests with crests and troughs with crests with crests and troughs with crests with crests and troughs with troughs so they add together and create troughs so they add together and create troughs so they add together and create an interference maximum a bright spot an interference maximum a bright spot an interference maximum a bright spot but if you look slightly to the left but if you look slightly to the left but if you look slightly to the left there's a dark spot now that's because there's a dark spot now that's because there's a dark spot now that's because light from one slit has to travel on an light from one slit has to travel on an light from one slit has to travel on an angle and it has to travel an extra half angle and it has to travel an extra half angle and it has to travel an extra half a wavelength compared to the light from a wavelength compared to the light from a wavelength compared to the light from the other slit which means when this the other slit which means when this the other slit which means when this light is arriving as a Crest the light light is arriving as a Crest the light light is arriving as a Crest the light from the other slit is arriving as a from the other slit is arriving as a from the other slit is arriving as a trough and so they cancel each other out trough and so they cancel each other out trough and so they cancel each other out but if you go further left you see but if you go further left you see but if you go further left you see another bright spot because now the another bright spot because now the another bright spot because now the light from one of the slits has to light from one of the slits has to light from one of the slits has to travel a full extra wavelength compared travel a full extra wavelength compared travel a full extra wavelength compared to the light from the other slit and so to the light from the other slit and so to the light from the other slit and so again they arrive in Phase crests with again they arrive in Phase crests with again they arrive in Phase crests with crests and troughs with troughs creating crests and troughs with troughs creating crests and troughs with troughs creating constructive interference and so we see constructive interference and so we see constructive interference and so we see a bright spot of light and that's how a bright spot of light and that's how a bright spot of light and that's how the whole pattern is created but what if the whole pattern is created but what if the whole pattern is created but what if I decreased the intensity so much that I decreased the intensity so much that I decreased the intensity so much that there wasn't a whole wave of light going there wasn't a whole wave of light going there wasn't a whole wave of light going through there there were only single through there there were only single through there there were only single photons then how could they interfere photons then how could they interfere photons then how could they interfere with each other because there's only one with each other because there's only one with each other because there's only one in the device at any one time so would in the device at any one time so would in the device at any one time so would we still see an interference pattern we still see an interference pattern we still see an interference pattern that is what we're going to find out in that is what we're going to find out in that is what we're going to find out in order to make this work I had to line up order to make this work I had to line up order to make this work I had to line up a very faint source and to see where the a very faint source and to see where the a very faint source and to see where the light was going I had to shroud my head light was going I had to shroud my head light was going I had to shroud my head in that black cloth but I finally have in that black cloth but I finally have in that black cloth but I finally have the apparatus ready you can see up here the apparatus ready you can see up here the apparatus ready you can see up here I have a frequency counter which I have a frequency counter which I have a frequency counter which actually counts the number of photons actually counts the number of photons actually counts the number of photons received per second at the detector the received per second at the detector the received per second at the detector the detector is a photo multiplier tube detector is a photo multiplier tube detector is a photo multiplier tube which is capable of detecting single which is capable of detecting single which is capable of detecting single photons it's like a very sensitive eye photons it's like a very sensitive eye photons it's like a very sensitive eye like the Frog's eye now right now like the Frog's eye now right now like the Frog's eye now right now there's no light passing through to the there's no light passing through to the there's no light passing through to the detector but there is still a bit of a detector but there is still a bit of a detector but there is still a bit of a background reading and that's because I background reading and that's because I background reading and that's because I can't block all the light out of there can't block all the light out of there can't block all the light out of there plus there are cosmic rays passing plus there are cosmic rays passing plus there are cosmic rays passing through this room which will also set through this room which will also set through this room which will also set off the detector I'm plotting a graph of off the detector I'm plotting a graph of off the detector I'm plotting a graph of the number of photons counted as a the number of photons counted as a the number of photons counted as a function of position across the detector function of position across the detector function of position across the detector if you have a look after 1 second the if you have a look after 1 second the if you have a look after 1 second the distribution seems random there doesn't distribution seems random there doesn't distribution seems random there doesn't seem to be any pattern in the seem to be any pattern in the seem to be any pattern in the arrangement of those photons as they hit arrangement of those photons as they hit arrangement of those photons as they hit the detector so maybe it's true a single the detector so maybe it's true a single the detector so maybe it's true a single Photon can't interfere with itself Photon can't interfere with itself Photon can't interfere with itself because it's just a localized point it because it's just a localized point it because it's just a localized point it has to go through one slit or the other has to go through one slit or the other has to go through one slit or the other but just to be sure let's add up the but just to be sure let's add up the but just to be sure let's add up the results over a period of time and see if results over a period of time and see if results over a period of time and see if any pattern [Music] [Music] [Music] emerges look at that you can clearly see emerges look at that you can clearly see emerges look at that you can clearly see the same interference pattern that we the same interference pattern that we the same interference pattern that we got when we were sending tons of photons got when we were sending tons of photons got when we were sending tons of photons through but we're getting it out of through but we're getting it out of through but we're getting it out of single photons we're counting up single photons we're counting up single photons we're counting up individual photons and that pattern is individual photons and that pattern is individual photons and that pattern is emerging as we aggregate the results emerging as we aggregate the results emerging as we aggregate the results over time but how could this be over time but how could this be over time but how could this be happening How could a single Photon pass happening How could a single Photon pass happening How could a single Photon pass through both through both through both slits well if we try to interpret these slits well if we try to interpret these slits well if we try to interpret these results in terms of the objects we results in terms of the objects we results in terms of the objects we experience every day they don't make any experience every day they don't make any experience every day they don't make any sense a photon is something different to sense a photon is something different to sense a photon is something different to a a macroscopic object it's not a wave a a macroscopic object it's not a wave a a macroscopic object it's not a wave and it's not a particle it's a quantum and it's not a particle it's a quantum and it's not a particle it's a quantum mechanical object and sometimes it seems mechanical object and sometimes it seems mechanical object and sometimes it seems like it has properties of a wave and like it has properties of a wave and like it has properties of a wave and sometimes it seems like it has sometimes it seems like it has sometimes it seems like it has properties of a particle but ultimately properties of a particle but ultimately properties of a particle but ultimately it is something totally different to it is something totally different to it is something totally different to anything we've experienced before and anything we've experienced before and anything we've experienced before and that's what makes this seem so that's what makes this seem so that's what makes this seem so counterintuitive so what is light wave counterintuitive so what is light wave counterintuitive so what is light wave or or or particle the true answer I think is particle the true answer I think is particle the true answer I think is neither though if you want you could neither though if you want you could neither though if you want you could call it a wave AC call it a wave AC call it a wave AC [Music] [Music] [Music] is created by the ripples from the two is created by the ripples from the two is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other sources interacting with each other sources interacting with each other where they meet up peaks with Peaks and where they meet up peaks with Peaks and where they meet up peaks with Peaks and troughs with troughs the amplitude of troughs with troughs the amplitude of troughs with troughs the amplitude of the wave is increased that's what we the wave is increased that's what we the wave is increased that's what we call constructive interference but if call constructive interference but if call constructive interference but if the Peak from one wave meets up with the the Peak from one wave meets up with the the Peak from one wave meets up with the at the end of the last video I asked why at the end of the last video I asked why at the end of the last video I asked why is it that the interference pattern is is it that the interference pattern is is it that the interference pattern is made by blobs rather than thin lines of made by blobs rather than thin lines of made by blobs rather than thin lines of light as it was in this experiment and light as it was in this experiment and light as it was in this experiment and in the comments I saw two common answers in the comments I saw two common answers in the comments I saw two common answers one was that the blobs were images of one was that the blobs were images of one was that the blobs were images of the Sun the other answer was that it was the Sun the other answer was that it was the Sun the other answer was that it was due to Heisenberg's uncertainty due to Heisenberg's uncertainty due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle now those were very thin slits principle now those were very thin slits principle now those were very thin slits so it's true Heisenberg's uncertainty so it's true Heisenberg's uncertainty so it's true Heisenberg's uncertainty principle would be involved and that principle would be involved and that principle would be involved and that light passing through each slit would light passing through each slit would light passing through each slit would spread out but the reason we actually spread out but the reason we actually spread out but the reason we actually saw blobs was because they were images saw blobs was because they were images saw blobs was because they were images of the Sun so if the sunlight comes of the Sun so if the sunlight comes of the Sun so if the sunlight comes through one slit it defract out and with through one slit it defract out and with through one slit it defract out and with spread out onto the bottom of the box spread out onto the bottom of the box spread out onto the bottom of the box and light from the other slit would do and light from the other slit would do and light from the other slit would do exactly the same and where those two exactly the same and where those two exactly the same and where those two spreads overlap is where we saw the spreads overlap is where we saw the spreads overlap is where we saw the three main blobs so there's a defraction three main blobs so there's a defraction three main blobs so there's a defraction maximum created by one slit and another maximum created by one slit and another maximum created by one slit and another defraction maximum created by the other defraction maximum created by the other defraction maximum created by the other slit and those two slit and those two slit and those two overlap but due to the light being in overlap but due to the light being in overlap but due to the light being in different phases it cancels out in different phases it cancels out in different phases it cancels out in certain positions creating those certain positions creating those certain positions creating those separate images of the Sun uh
