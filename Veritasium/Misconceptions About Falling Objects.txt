WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en let's say Jack holds both balls above let's say Jack holds both balls above let's say Jack holds both balls above his head and then he drops them at his head and then he drops them at his head and then he drops them at exactly the same time what do you expect exactly the same time what do you expect exactly the same time what do you expect to see well they're going to hit the to see well they're going to hit the to see well they're going to hit the ground at the same time I expect them to ground at the same time I expect them to ground at the same time I expect them to both land at the same time the same time both land at the same time the same time both land at the same time the same time same same same time this one to hit the ground first time this one to hit the ground first time this one to hit the ground first however they will actually both hit the however they will actually both hit the however they will actually both hit the ground at the same time why is that ground at the same time why is that ground at the same time why is that science yeah science now the black one science yeah science now the black one science yeah science now the black one clearly feels a lot heavier so the clearly feels a lot heavier so the clearly feels a lot heavier so the standard misconception is to believe standard misconception is to believe standard misconception is to believe that the black ball will accelerate at a that the black ball will accelerate at a that the black ball will accelerate at a greater rate and reach the ground first greater rate and reach the ground first greater rate and reach the ground first this year many people had an idea that this year many people had an idea that this year many people had an idea that both balls would land at the same time both balls would land at the same time both balls would land at the same time but they didn't know exactly why I found but they didn't know exactly why I found but they didn't know exactly why I found there were some different misconceptions there were some different misconceptions there were some different misconceptions for example many people seem to think for example many people seem to think for example many people seem to think that as an object falls towards the that as an object falls towards the that as an object falls towards the Earth it falls with a constant speed Earth it falls with a constant speed Earth it falls with a constant speed from this hot yeah pretty much just a from this hot yeah pretty much just a from this hot yeah pretty much just a constant speed all the way down speed constant speed all the way down speed constant speed all the way down speed yeah I think it'll be the same constant yeah I think it'll be the same constant yeah I think it'll be the same constant speed I think it's constant I seem to speed I think it's constant I seem to speed I think it's constant I seem to remember it being constant I did remember it being constant I did remember it being constant I did decently in physics and I se to remember decently in physics and I se to remember decently in physics and I se to remember that's the answer whereas the truth is that's the answer whereas the truth is that's the answer whereas the truth is the speed of both balls is changing all the speed of both balls is changing all the speed of both balls is changing all the time the balls are speeding up as the time the balls are speeding up as the time the balls are speeding up as they go towards the ground that's what they go towards the ground that's what they go towards the ground that's what the force of gravity does on them it the force of gravity does on them it the force of gravity does on them it makes them accelerate it gets them to makes them accelerate it gets them to makes them accelerate it gets them to speed up another misconception I speed up another misconception I speed up another misconception I discovered was that some people believe discovered was that some people believe discovered was that some people believe both balls should have the same both balls should have the same both balls should have the same gravitational force on them even though gravitational force on them even though gravitational force on them even though the black ball is clearly much much the black ball is clearly much much the black ball is clearly much much heavier the reason I think they said heavier the reason I think they said heavier the reason I think they said this was because they knew both balls this was because they knew both balls this was because they knew both balls needed to reach the ground at the same needed to reach the ground at the same needed to reach the ground at the same time so they reasoned that the force on time so they reasoned that the force on time so they reasoned that the force on them must be the same tell me about how them must be the same tell me about how them must be the same tell me about how the gravitational force on this ball the gravitational force on this ball the gravitational force on this ball compares to the gravitational force on compares to the gravitational force on compares to the gravitational force on that ball the force is the same it's that ball the force is the same it's that ball the force is the same it's going to be very similar in terms of going to be very similar in terms of going to be very similar in terms of gravitational pool they're both have the gravitational pool they're both have the gravitational pool they're both have the same and they'll fall at the same rate same and they'll fall at the same rate same and they'll fall at the same rate I'm not like Einstein but same I'm not like Einstein but same I'm not like Einstein but same gravitational force around the whole gravitational force around the whole gravitational force around the whole world right cuz the gravitational pull world right cuz the gravitational pull world right cuz the gravitational pull on the earth is the same on both objects on the earth is the same on both objects on the earth is the same on both objects are you saying that the force on them is are you saying that the force on them is are you saying that the force on them is the same the pull is the same but you the same the pull is the same but you the same the pull is the same but you felt the pole and you've told me the felt the pole and you've told me the felt the pole and you've told me the pole is different no I said the weight pole is different no I said the weight pole is different no I said the weight is different I didn't say the pole is is different I didn't say the pole is is different I didn't say the pole is different it is heavier and has more different it is heavier and has more different it is heavier and has more gravitational pull but when I drop them gravitational pull but when I drop them gravitational pull but when I drop them then they get equal a gravitational pull then they get equal a gravitational pull then they get equal a gravitational pull somehow don't you think it's going to be somehow don't you think it's going to be somehow don't you think it's going to be like five times as much yeah you think like five times as much yeah you think like five times as much yeah you think but it's not the way you're asking it but it's not the way you're asking it but it's not the way you're asking it yes but scientifically speaking no the yes but scientifically speaking no the yes but scientifically speaking no the gravitational force on both these fors gravitational force on both these fors gravitational force on both these fors are the same okay the gravitational are the same okay the gravitational are the same okay the gravitational force on both of these BS is the same is force on both of these BS is the same is force on both of these BS is the same is that what you actually believe no but it that what you actually believe no but it that what you actually believe no but it is tell me tell me what you believe I is tell me tell me what you believe I is tell me tell me what you believe I believe it should be more on this simply believe it should be more on this simply believe it should be more on this simply for the fact that this is heavier and for the fact that this is heavier and for the fact that this is heavier and just intuition tells me that should be just intuition tells me that should be just intuition tells me that should be more but after learning physics we learn more but after learning physics we learn more but after learning physics we learn that it is actually the same I actually that it is actually the same I actually that it is actually the same I actually think the force on this ball is more the think the force on this ball is more the think the force on this ball is more the force on this I I swear I'm not trying force on this I I swear I'm not trying force on this I I swear I'm not trying to mess with to mess with to mess with you so like in in real life in real life you so like in in real life in real life you so like in in real life in real life and in physics I will tell you that the and in physics I will tell you that the and in physics I will tell you that the force on this ball is more all right force on this ball is more all right force on this ball is more all right ready three two ready three two ready three two one yep see same one yep see same one yep see same time same time same time I would say the time same time same time I would say the time same time same time I would say the force on the medicine ball is like a lot force on the medicine ball is like a lot force on the medicine ball is like a lot more because it's got a lot more weight more because it's got a lot more weight more because it's got a lot more weight it's got a lot more mass but it's got a it's got a lot more mass but it's got a it's got a lot more mass but it's got a lot more inertia yeah yeah oh you guys lot more inertia yeah yeah oh you guys lot more inertia yeah yeah oh you guys remember that right it's got a lot of remember that right it's got a lot of remember that right it's got a lot of resistance to acceleration so it takes resistance to acceleration so it takes resistance to acceleration so it takes more Force to get it accelerating at the more Force to get it accelerating at the more Force to get it accelerating at the same rate as this ball and that's why same rate as this ball and that's why same rate as this ball and that's why they accelerate at the same rate thank they accelerate at the same rate thank they accelerate at the same rate thank you guys so much for playing along I you guys so much for playing along I you guys so much for playing along I appreciate that sorry it's all right
