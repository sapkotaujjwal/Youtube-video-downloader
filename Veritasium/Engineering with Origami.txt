of inspiration for all types of applications from medical devices to applications from medical devices to applications from medical devices to space applications and even stopping space applications and even stopping space applications and even stopping bullets bullets bullets but why is it that this ancient art of but why is it that this ancient art of but why is it that this ancient art of paper folding is so useful for modern paper folding is so useful for modern paper folding is so useful for modern engineering engineering engineering origami literally folding paper dates origami literally folding paper dates origami literally folding paper dates back at least 400 years in japan back at least 400 years in japan back at least 400 years in japan but the number of designs was limited but the number of designs was limited but the number of designs was limited there were only a handful of patterns there were only a handful of patterns there were only a handful of patterns maybe 100 200 total in japan maybe 100 200 total in japan maybe 100 200 total in japan nowadays there are tens of thousands nowadays there are tens of thousands nowadays there are tens of thousands that have been documented and most of that have been documented and most of that have been documented and most of that change happened in the 20th century that change happened in the 20th century that change happened in the 20th century there were a handful of japanese origami there were a handful of japanese origami there were a handful of japanese origami masters and by far the most successful masters and by far the most successful masters and by far the most successful of them was a man named akira yoshizawa of them was a man named akira yoshizawa of them was a man named akira yoshizawa who who who created thousands of new designs wrote created thousands of new designs wrote created thousands of new designs wrote many many books of his works many many books of his works many many books of his works and his work inspired a worldwide and his work inspired a worldwide and his work inspired a worldwide renaissance of origami creativity well i renaissance of origami creativity well i renaissance of origami creativity well i wanted to fold a cactus wanted to fold a cactus wanted to fold a cactus the first thing one needed to do the first thing one needed to do the first thing one needed to do is figure out how do i get spines on a is figure out how do i get spines on a is figure out how do i get spines on a cactus so you can imagine if i can make cactus so you can imagine if i can make cactus so you can imagine if i can make two spines here two spines here two spines here i could do the same thing to make a i could do the same thing to make a i could do the same thing to make a whole row whole row whole row then i can go back do a complete design then i can go back do a complete design then i can go back do a complete design that's what this is that's what this is that's what this is [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] and and and and this is actually the cactus and the and this is actually the cactus and the and this is actually the cactus and the pot pot pot are from a single sheet of paper are from a single sheet of paper are from a single sheet of paper the paper's green on one side red on the the paper's green on one side red on the the paper's green on one side red on the other that whole thing is this thing so other that whole thing is this thing so other that whole thing is this thing so this is this is this is this is this is this is one uncut square of paper one uncut square of paper one uncut square of paper how big was that piece of paper and this how big was that piece of paper and this how big was that piece of paper and this is about a one meter square is about a one meter square is about a one meter square so so so there is a huge amount of size reduction there is a huge amount of size reduction there is a huge amount of size reduction to go from a meter down to here but you to go from a meter down to here but you to go from a meter down to here but you need that to get all of the spines and need that to get all of the spines and need that to get all of the spines and how long did that take to make how long did that take to make how long did that take to make that that that took about seven years took about seven years took about seven years from start to finish from start to finish from start to finish wow wow wow why is origami this why is origami this why is origami this thing that was created for aesthetics thing that was created for aesthetics thing that was created for aesthetics mainly why is it so useful i guess is mainly why is it so useful i guess is mainly why is it so useful i guess is the question for for like you know the question for for like you know the question for for like you know structural things that were for structural things that were for structural things that were for mechanical engineering or for space mechanical engineering or for space mechanical engineering or for space applications like why does it find applications like why does it find applications like why does it find itself in so many of these applications itself in so many of these applications itself in so many of these applications why is it so useful well the thing that makes origami well the thing that makes origami well the thing that makes origami useful useful useful is it is a way is it is a way is it is a way of transforming a flat sheet of transforming a flat sheet of transforming a flat sheet into some other shape with relatively into some other shape with relatively into some other shape with relatively little processing little processing little processing this is a folded pattern this is a folded pattern this is a folded pattern it's called a triangulated cylinder it it's called a triangulated cylinder it it's called a triangulated cylinder it is by stable meaning it's stable in two is by stable meaning it's stable in two is by stable meaning it's stable in two positions this is one and then if i give positions this is one and then if i give positions this is one and then if i give it a twist it a twist it a twist this is the other this really has a this is the other this really has a this is the other this really has a bunch of bi-stable mechanisms in it bunch of bi-stable mechanisms in it bunch of bi-stable mechanisms in it because i can because i can because i can you can see how it sort of pops into you can see how it sort of pops into you can see how it sort of pops into place place place but if you combine the two mechanisms but if you combine the two mechanisms but if you combine the two mechanisms going in different directions then you going in different directions then you going in different directions then you get the sort of magical color change get the sort of magical color change get the sort of magical color change effect yeah that's impressive so you effect yeah that's impressive so you effect yeah that's impressive so you look at this and you say okay that is a look at this and you say okay that is a look at this and you say okay that is a cute paper toy cute paper toy cute paper toy is it anything more than that and the is it anything more than that and the is it anything more than that and the answer is yes answer is yes answer is yes does that turn into that does that turn into that does that turn into that turns into that yep we're working with a turns into that yep we're working with a turns into that yep we're working with a company called two against surgical that company called two against surgical that company called two against surgical that does the da vinci surgical robot does the da vinci surgical robot does the da vinci surgical robot where they wanted to be able to insert a where they wanted to be able to insert a where they wanted to be able to insert a flexible catheter with uh with the robot flexible catheter with uh with the robot flexible catheter with uh with the robot but the flexible catheters tend to but the flexible catheters tend to but the flexible catheters tend to buckle and stuff so we had buckle and stuff so we had buckle and stuff so we had developed these developed these developed these origami bellows origami bellows origami bellows that if you look down there there's uh that if you look down there there's uh that if you look down there there's uh a hole that no matter how far we move a hole that no matter how far we move a hole that no matter how far we move this that that stays the same size this that that stays the same size this that that stays the same size on the inside and what that means is we on the inside and what that means is we on the inside and what that means is we can put the catheter in there can put the catheter in there can put the catheter in there and as the catheter moves and it's and as the catheter moves and it's and as the catheter moves and it's getting inserted into the body it still getting inserted into the body it still getting inserted into the body it still has supports along the way has supports along the way has supports along the way or for another example or for another example or for another example here i have a foldable here i have a foldable here i have a foldable bulletproof bulletproof bulletproof collapsible wall it's based on the yoshimura crease it's based on the yoshimura crease it's based on the yoshimura crease pattern meanings might make this out of pattern meanings might make this out of pattern meanings might make this out of a bulletproof material can be very a bulletproof material can be very a bulletproof material can be very compact being a police officer's car compact being a police officer's car compact being a police officer's car and deploy out and be bulletproof and deploy out and be bulletproof and deploy out and be bulletproof but would it actually work but would it actually work but would it actually work well they've put it to the test using 12 layers of kevlar it can stop using 12 layers of kevlar it can stop using 12 layers of kevlar it can stop bullets from a handgun and a new design bullets from a handgun and a new design bullets from a handgun and a new design featuring interchangeable panels should featuring interchangeable panels should featuring interchangeable panels should be able to stop rifle rounds be able to stop rifle rounds be able to stop rifle rounds those and that vial that is those are those and that vial that is those are those and that vial that is those are actually actually actually bullets that have been stopped by bullets that have been stopped by bullets that have been stopped by origami origami origami an intrinsic benefit of origami is that an intrinsic benefit of origami is that an intrinsic benefit of origami is that the simple act of folding a material can the simple act of folding a material can the simple act of folding a material can make it more rigid make it more rigid make it more rigid i was going to ask you about this i was going to ask you about this i was going to ask you about this yeah more origami but i was going to say it's a way of but i was going to say it's a way of but i was going to say it's a way of making the can stronger without actually making the can stronger without actually making the can stronger without actually like thinner metal right like thinner metal right like thinner metal right but for engineering applications the but for engineering applications the but for engineering applications the more common challenge is how to fold more common challenge is how to fold more common challenge is how to fold thick rigid materials this is uh thick rigid materials this is uh thick rigid materials this is uh polypropylene okay very rigid there's no polypropylene okay very rigid there's no polypropylene okay very rigid there's no way that i'm going to be able to to fold way that i'm going to be able to to fold way that i'm going to be able to to fold that into that into that into this vertex so this is an example it this vertex so this is an example it this vertex so this is an example it shows a couple things surrogate folds we shows a couple things surrogate folds we shows a couple things surrogate folds we can use to replace the the creases and can use to replace the the creases and can use to replace the the creases and then also then also then also that piece of polypropylene folds up and that piece of polypropylene folds up and that piece of polypropylene folds up and it also accommodates the thickness it also accommodates the thickness it also accommodates the thickness by cutting or scoring materials and by cutting or scoring materials and by cutting or scoring materials and adding hinges as necessary thick rigid adding hinges as necessary thick rigid adding hinges as necessary thick rigid materials can in effect be folded materials can in effect be folded materials can in effect be folded this is useful for example in deploying this is useful for example in deploying this is useful for example in deploying solar panels solar panels solar panels this pattern is perhaps the granddaddy this pattern is perhaps the granddaddy this pattern is perhaps the granddaddy of deployable structures it's called the of deployable structures it's called the of deployable structures it's called the miura ori it's been used for solar miura ori it's been used for solar miura ori it's been used for solar arrays in fact it was one of the first arrays in fact it was one of the first arrays in fact it was one of the first patterns that flew on a space mission patterns that flew on a space mission patterns that flew on a space mission back in 1995 back in 1995 back in 1995 it was called the space flyer mission as it was called the space flyer mission as it was called the space flyer mission as you see here you see here you see here it all it all it all opens and closes in a single motion and opens and closes in a single motion and opens and closes in a single motion and when it flattens it's it's very thin and when it flattens it's it's very thin and when it flattens it's it's very thin and compact it's a fun pattern called the compact it's a fun pattern called the compact it's a fun pattern called the origami flasher and origami flasher and origami flasher and you get you get you get this kind of interesting this kind of interesting this kind of interesting flasher motion flasher motion flasher motion this has been proposed as a design for this has been proposed as a design for this has been proposed as a design for satellite solar arrays increasing satellite solar arrays increasing satellite solar arrays increasing compactness for launch and reliability compactness for launch and reliability compactness for launch and reliability in deployment in deployment in deployment [Music] [Music] [Music] a new area for origami research is in a new area for origami research is in a new area for origami research is in improving the aerodynamics of freight improving the aerodynamics of freight improving the aerodynamics of freight locomotives the thing with freight locomotives the thing with freight locomotives the thing with freight locomotives is you know they're just locomotives is you know they're just locomotives is you know they're just like bricks going down the tracks so like bricks going down the tracks so like bricks going down the tracks so their aerodynamics are horrible ideally their aerodynamics are horrible ideally their aerodynamics are horrible ideally i'd like to have a nose cone on the i'd like to have a nose cone on the i'd like to have a nose cone on the front of a freight locomotive to improve front of a freight locomotive to improve front of a freight locomotive to improve the aerodynamics but you can't because the aerodynamics but you can't because the aerodynamics but you can't because they're like lego blocks they're hooked they're like lego blocks they're hooked they're like lego blocks they're hooked up anywhere along the train you don't up anywhere along the train you don't up anywhere along the train you don't know if it's the first one or the second know if it's the first one or the second know if it's the first one or the second one or the third one here's a one or the third one here's a one or the third one here's a scaled prototype showing a pattern that scaled prototype showing a pattern that scaled prototype showing a pattern that we demonstrated on a freight locomotive we demonstrated on a freight locomotive we demonstrated on a freight locomotive it folds up to be it folds up to be it folds up to be very flat very flat very flat but then deploys out and it turns out but then deploys out and it turns out but then deploys out and it turns out our our our computer models and wind tunnel testing computer models and wind tunnel testing computer models and wind tunnel testing show that this will save this one show that this will save this one show that this will save this one company multiple millions of dollars a company multiple millions of dollars a company multiple millions of dollars a year in diesel year in diesel year in diesel [Music] this is a violinist it was one of my this is a violinist it was one of my this is a violinist it was one of my favorite mechanism designs because favorite mechanism designs because favorite mechanism designs because he fiddles if you pull his head he fiddles if you pull his head he fiddles if you pull his head fantastic fantastic fantastic functional motions of origami are functional motions of origami are functional motions of origami are inspiring new designs for devices inspiring new designs for devices inspiring new designs for devices like compliant mechanisms that can like compliant mechanisms that can like compliant mechanisms that can complete full 360 degree rotations complete full 360 degree rotations complete full 360 degree rotations unlike a traditional mechanisms with you unlike a traditional mechanisms with you unlike a traditional mechanisms with you know bearings or hinges i can hook on a know bearings or hinges i can hook on a know bearings or hinges i can hook on a motor and i can get continuous motor and i can get continuous motor and i can get continuous revolution revolution revolution i couldn't do that with a compliant i couldn't do that with a compliant i couldn't do that with a compliant mechanism but it turns out no one mechanism but it turns out no one mechanism but it turns out no one bothered to tell the paper folders that bothered to tell the paper folders that bothered to tell the paper folders that and and and created created created a uh continuously revolving compliant uh continuously revolving compliant uh continuously revolving compliant mechanism mechanism mechanism which is called a kalita cycle which is called a kalita cycle which is called a kalita cycle origami motions are also being used in origami motions are also being used in origami motions are also being used in medical devices these would be medical devices these would be medical devices these would be you know the creases in the paper you know the creases in the paper you know the creases in the paper uh uh uh and we have here now uh forceps and we have here now uh forceps and we have here now uh forceps and so what's nice about this is we and so what's nice about this is we and so what's nice about this is we could put this at a smaller scale right could put this at a smaller scale right could put this at a smaller scale right on the medical instrument to go into the on the medical instrument to go into the on the medical instrument to go into the body body body but then can morph but then can morph but then can morph and become the gripper so it'll be very and become the gripper so it'll be very and become the gripper so it'll be very small incision but then go in and do small incision but then go in and do small incision but then go in and do some more complex tasks inside the body some more complex tasks inside the body some more complex tasks inside the body a variant of this mini gripper is now a variant of this mini gripper is now a variant of this mini gripper is now being used in robotic surgeries being used in robotic surgeries being used in robotic surgeries replacing the previous mechanism and replacing the previous mechanism and replacing the previous mechanism and reducing the number of parts by 75 reducing the number of parts by 75 reducing the number of parts by 75 percent percent percent the origami inspired device is smaller the origami inspired device is smaller the origami inspired device is smaller but with a wider range of motion but with a wider range of motion but with a wider range of motion and functional origami can be and functional origami can be and functional origami can be miniaturized even further this is the miniaturized even further this is the miniaturized even further this is the world's smallest origami flapping bird that sounds cool this one was devoted that sounds cool this one was devoted that sounds cool this one was devoted to developing to developing to developing techniques to make techniques to make techniques to make microscopic self-folding origami and microscopic self-folding origami and microscopic self-folding origami and what you see here is a microscope photo what you see here is a microscope photo what you see here is a microscope photo of the finished bird of the finished bird of the finished bird but but but what the bird actually looks like what the bird actually looks like what the bird actually looks like well well well i'll need my micro lens you'll probably i'll need my micro lens you'll probably i'll need my micro lens you'll probably need need need not just your macro lens you'll need not just your macro lens you'll need not just your macro lens you'll need your microscope your microscope your microscope because it's smaller than a grain of because it's smaller than a grain of because it's smaller than a grain of salt so it started out it was a bit less salt so it started out it was a bit less salt so it started out it was a bit less than a millimeter square than a millimeter square than a millimeter square but when it's folded but when it's folded but when it's folded it's much much smaller wow it's much much smaller wow it's much much smaller wow now now now you might ask yourself you might ask yourself you might ask yourself what would anyone ever use what would anyone ever use what would anyone ever use a microscopic flapping bird for and the a microscopic flapping bird for and the a microscopic flapping bird for and the answer is well nothing for a flapping answer is well nothing for a flapping answer is well nothing for a flapping bird bird bird but but but there are there are there are medical devices medical applications medical devices medical applications medical devices medical applications implants that are microscopic where you implants that are microscopic where you implants that are microscopic where you might want a little machine might want a little machine might want a little machine this

a one centimeter wide computer chip centimeter wide computer chip centimeter wide computer chip there's some things down there that kind there's some things down there that kind there's some things down there that kind of look about star wars to me yes this of look about star wars to me yes this of look about star wars to me yes this art called elliptic infinity art called elliptic infinity art called elliptic infinity and we wanted to do that in a material and we wanted to do that in a material and we wanted to do that in a material other than paper other than paper other than paper you see this you see this you see this from flat from flat from flat into that elliptic infinity shape this into that elliptic infinity shape this into that elliptic infinity shape this is actually a lamp is actually a lamp is actually a lamp that's made from a single sheet so it that's made from a single sheet so it that's made from a single sheet so it comes in an envelope like this put its comes in an envelope like this put its comes in an envelope like this put its cable in cable in cable in fold it add a clip add a clip add a clip now this relies on now this relies on now this relies on a lot of math the curvature of these a lot of math the curvature of these a lot of math the curvature of these lines affects links lines affects links lines affects links the bending and curvature here to here the bending and curvature here to here the bending and curvature here to here to here all of these are coupled and to here all of these are coupled and to here all of these are coupled and pretty much the only way to design them pretty much the only way to design them pretty much the only way to design them and get all the folds to play together and get all the folds to play together and get all the folds to play together is by following mathematical methods my is by following mathematical methods my is by following mathematical methods my professional background is mathematics professional background is mathematics professional background is mathematics and physics i i did laser physics for 15 and physics i i did laser physics for 15 and physics i i did laser physics for 15 years as a profession i got my phd in years as a profession i got my phd in years as a profession i got my phd in applied physics applied physics applied physics and my kind of my job in many cases was and my kind of my job in many cases was and my kind of my job in many cases was to figure out how to describe to figure out how to describe to figure out how to describe lasers mathematically and if i could put lasers mathematically and if i could put lasers mathematically and if i could put my problem in the mathematical language my problem in the mathematical language my problem in the mathematical language then i could rely on the tools of then i could rely on the tools of then i could rely on the tools of mathematics mathematics mathematics to solve those problems and to to solve those problems and to to solve those problems and to accomplish the goals but accomplish the goals but accomplish the goals but i also felt like i also felt like i also felt like origami would be amenable to that same origami would be amenable to that same origami would be amenable to that same approach approach approach so i started trying to figure out how to so i started trying to figure out how to so i started trying to figure out how to describe origami using the tools of describe origami using the tools of describe origami using the tools of mathematics and that worked i'm sort of mathematics and that worked i'm sort of mathematics and that worked i'm sort of fascinated about the math here fascinated about the math here fascinated about the math here like like like it's hard for me to conceive of like it's hard for me to conceive of like it's hard for me to conceive of like what does that math look like the math what does that math look like the math what does that math look like the math comes down comes down comes down to uh a way of representing a design to uh a way of representing a design to uh a way of representing a design called a crease pattern let me grab a called a crease pattern let me grab a called a crease pattern let me grab a couple of crease patterns okay couple of crease patterns okay couple of crease patterns okay so this is an origami crease pattern so this is an origami crease pattern so this is an origami crease pattern it's a plan it's a plan it's a plan for how to fold in this case how to fold for how to fold in this case how to fold for how to fold in this case how to fold a scorpion a really good way a scorpion a really good way a scorpion a really good way of designing something like this is to of designing something like this is to of designing something like this is to represent represent represent every feature every feature every feature claw leg tail claw leg tail claw leg tail by a circular by a circular by a circular region a circular shape region a circular shape region a circular shape it's not circular folds it's an abstract it's not circular folds it's an abstract it's not circular folds it's an abstract it's an abstract concept that you it's an abstract concept that you it's an abstract concept that you represent the pattern by a circle but represent the pattern by a circle but represent the pattern by a circle but then you find an arrangement of those then you find an arrangement of those then you find an arrangement of those circles on the square circles on the square circles on the square like like like packing packing packing balls into a box balls into a box balls into a box so so so for the scorpion you've got a long tail for the scorpion you've got a long tail for the scorpion you've got a long tail imagine a big circle like a big tin can imagine a big circle like a big tin can imagine a big circle like a big tin can and the legs are smaller circles or and the legs are smaller circles or and the legs are smaller circles or circles of different sizes so you've got circles of different sizes so you've got circles of different sizes so you've got different smaller cans and the claws are different smaller cans and the claws are different smaller cans and the claws are a couple more circles and you're going a couple more circles and you're going a couple more circles and you're going to put them into a square box to put them into a square box to put them into a square box in such a way that they all fit in such a way that they all fit in such a way that they all fit so you pack the circles so you pack the circles so you pack the circles into the box and into the box and into the box and the arrangement of those circles the arrangement of those circles the arrangement of those circles tells you the tells you the tells you the the skeleton of the crease pattern and the skeleton of the crease pattern and the skeleton of the crease pattern and and from that you can geometrically and from that you can geometrically and from that you can geometrically construct all the crease patterns you construct all the crease patterns you construct all the crease patterns you follow rules follow rules follow rules put a line between the center of every put a line between the center of every put a line between the center of every pair of circles pair of circles pair of circles um um um and then whenever any two lines meet in and then whenever any two lines meet in and then whenever any two lines meet in a v a v a v you add a fold halfway in between it's you add a fold halfway in between it's you add a fold halfway in between it's called a ridge fold called a ridge fold called a ridge fold and there's similar more complicated and there's similar more complicated and there's similar more complicated rules for adding more and more lines but rules for adding more and more lines but rules for adding more and more lines but the thing is it's all step by step it the thing is it's all step by step it the thing is it's all step by step it says it says it says it if you find this geometric pattern that if you find this geometric pattern that if you find this geometric pattern that tells you where to add the next line and tells you where to add the next line and tells you where to add the next line and you go through that process until you've you go through that process until you've you go through that process until you've constructed all the lines and when constructed all the lines and when constructed all the lines and when you're done you can take away the you're done you can take away the you're done you can take away the circles circles circles they were the scaffolding for your they were the scaffolding for your they were the scaffolding for your pattern and the pattern of lines that's pattern and the pattern of lines that's pattern and the pattern of lines that's left left left is the are the folds you need to create is the are the folds you need to create is the are the folds you need to create the shape and that's what's shown here the shape and that's what's shown here the shape and that's what's shown here and this was probably the biggest and this was probably the biggest and this was probably the biggest revolution revolution revolution in in in the world of origami design was if you the world of origami design was if you the world of origami design was if you followed that systematic process followed that systematic process followed that systematic process the fold pattern the fold pattern the fold pattern would give you would give you would give you the exact shape that you set out to fold the exact shape that you set out to fold the exact shape that you set out to fold to begin with the circle packing method to begin with the circle packing method to begin with the circle packing method that i described this works for anything that i described this works for anything that i described this works for anything that can be represented that can be represented that can be represented as a stick figure like a scorpion you as a stick figure like a scorpion you as a stick figure like a scorpion you could draw this as a stick figure with a could draw this as a stick figure with a could draw this as a stick figure with a line for the body and tail line for the body and tail line for the body and tail lines for each of the legs lines for the lines for each of the legs lines for the lines for each of the legs lines for the claws and from that stick figure claws and from that stick figure claws and from that stick figure from any stick figure you can use circle from any stick figure you can use circle from any stick figure you can use circle packing and get a shape that folds it packing and get a shape that folds it packing and get a shape that folds it but suppose the thing you're folding is but suppose the thing you're folding is but suppose the thing you're folding is not not not a stick figure suppose it's something a stick figure suppose it's something a stick figure suppose it's something that's more like a surface that's more like a surface that's more like a surface like a sphere like a sphere like a sphere or you know or a cloud or or just in or you know or a cloud or or just in or you know or a cloud or or just in animal terms a big blobby body like an animal terms a big blobby body like an animal terms a big blobby body like an elephant elephant elephant stick figure algorithm is not going to stick figure algorithm is not going to stick figure algorithm is not going to work but there are other algorithms for work but there are other algorithms for work but there are other algorithms for that about 10 years ago a japanese that about 10 years ago a japanese that about 10 years ago a japanese mathematician named mathematician named mathematician named tomohiro tachi tomohiro tachi tomohiro tachi developed developed developed an algorithm that works for any surface an algorithm that works for any surface an algorithm that works for any surface you give it a triangulated surface as a you give it a triangulated surface as a you give it a triangulated surface as a mathematical description and he will mathematical description and he will mathematical description and he will give you or his algorithm will give you give you or his algorithm will give you give you or his algorithm will give you the folding pattern that folds into that the folding pattern that folds into that the folding pattern that folds into that surface it's now quite famous and it's surface it's now quite famous and it's surface it's now quite famous and it's called origamizer called origamizer called origamizer and that is a way you could make and that is a way you could make and that is a way you could make a sheet of anything a sheet of anything a sheet of anything and take on any three-dimensional shape and take on any three-dimensional shape and take on any three-dimensional shape so origami is useful in engineering so origami is useful in engineering so origami is useful in engineering because it provides a method of taking a because it provides a method of taking a because it provides a method of taking a flat sheet of material and forming it flat sheet of material and forming it flat sheet of material and forming it into virtually any shape by folding into virtually any shape by folding into virtually any shape by folding or if the end product is flat origami or if the end product is flat origami or if the end product is flat origami offers a way to reduce its dimensions offers a way to reduce its dimensions offers a way to reduce its dimensions while still deploying easily while still deploying easily while still deploying easily the simple act of folding can increase the simple act of folding can increase the simple act of folding can increase rigidity rigidity rigidity or origami can take advantage of the or origami can take advantage of the or origami can take advantage of the flexibility of materials to create flexibility of materials to create flexibility of materials to create specific motions specific motions specific motions and its principles are scalable enabling and its principles are scalable enabling and its principles are scalable enabling the miniaturization of devices the
