some defective x-ray it all started with some defective x-ray it all started with some defective x-ray film film film kodak found when they developed unused kodak found when they developed unused kodak found when they developed unused film it showed tens or even film it showed tens or even film it showed tens or even a hundred little dark spots the film had a hundred little dark spots the film had a hundred little dark spots the film had been exposed to radiation even though it been exposed to radiation even though it been exposed to radiation even though it had never been taken out of its had never been taken out of its had never been taken out of its packaging packaging packaging this was actually not a new problem this was actually not a new problem this was actually not a new problem during world war during world war during world war ii radium was used extensively to make ii radium was used extensively to make ii radium was used extensively to make glow-in-the-dark dials flight glow-in-the-dark dials flight glow-in-the-dark dials flight instruments and instruments and instruments and watches radium glows because it is watches radium glows because it is watches radium glows because it is radioactive it gives off alpha particles radioactive it gives off alpha particles radioactive it gives off alpha particles now some of this radium ended up on now some of this radium ended up on now some of this radium ended up on paper and cardboard at these factories paper and cardboard at these factories paper and cardboard at these factories and because supplies were scarce and because supplies were scarce and because supplies were scarce leftover paper products were leftover paper products were leftover paper products were salvaged and recycled leading small salvaged and recycled leading small salvaged and recycled leading small amounts of radium to amounts of radium to amounts of radium to end up in the general paper supply and end up in the general paper supply and end up in the general paper supply and when this paper was used to package up when this paper was used to package up when this paper was used to package up kodak film kodak film kodak film radiation from radium would expose the radiation from radium would expose the radiation from radium would expose the film before it was ever used film before it was ever used film before it was ever used and it was such a problem that kodak and it was such a problem that kodak and it was such a problem that kodak altered their supply chain carefully altered their supply chain carefully altered their supply chain carefully selecting selecting selecting just a few paper mills where they could just a few paper mills where they could just a few paper mills where they could strictly control the raw materials strictly control the raw materials strictly control the raw materials one of the mills was in vincennes one of the mills was in vincennes one of the mills was in vincennes indiana on the wabash river indiana on the wabash river indiana on the wabash river it made strawboard which was inserted it made strawboard which was inserted it made strawboard which was inserted between sheets of x-ray film between sheets of x-ray film between sheets of x-ray film now for months this strawboard was now for months this strawboard was now for months this strawboard was working perfectly until a batch working perfectly until a batch working perfectly until a batch manufactured on august 6 1945 started to manufactured on august 6 1945 started to manufactured on august 6 1945 started to cause spots to appear on the x-ray film cause spots to appear on the x-ray film cause spots to appear on the x-ray film so julian webb a scientist at kodak was so julian webb a scientist at kodak was so julian webb a scientist at kodak was tasked with solving the problem tasked with solving the problem tasked with solving the problem so he punched out little holes of so he punched out little holes of so he punched out little holes of strawboard behind where the film had strawboard behind where the film had strawboard behind where the film had been exposed been exposed been exposed and then he measured the alpha particles and then he measured the alpha particles and then he measured the alpha particles coming off that material coming off that material coming off that material but the level was not appreciably higher but the level was not appreciably higher but the level was not appreciably higher than background than background than background and this ruled out radium and the other and this ruled out radium and the other and this ruled out radium and the other naturally occurring isotopes of uranium naturally occurring isotopes of uranium naturally occurring isotopes of uranium thorium and actinium thorium and actinium thorium and actinium all alpha emitters but when he measured all alpha emitters but when he measured all alpha emitters but when he measured beta radiation beta radiation beta radiation he found significant activity this he found significant activity this he found significant activity this matched what he saw on the film matched what he saw on the film matched what he saw on the film the radiation penetrated several layers the radiation penetrated several layers the radiation penetrated several layers something beta particles can do something beta particles can do something beta particles can do but not alpha and over a period of but not alpha and over a period of but not alpha and over a period of months months months he measured the half-life of the he measured the half-life of the he measured the half-life of the radioactive substance finding it was radioactive substance finding it was radioactive substance finding it was only about 30 days only about 30 days only about 30 days this half-life combined with the energy this half-life combined with the energy this half-life combined with the energy of the beta particles led webb to of the beta particles led webb to of the beta particles led webb to conclude that the radioactive conclude that the radioactive conclude that the radioactive contaminant was most likely contaminant was most likely contaminant was most likely cerium 141 an isotope that could cerium 141 an isotope that could cerium 141 an isotope that could only have come from a nuclear fission only have come from a nuclear fission only have come from a nuclear fission explosion what's more the same contaminant what's more the same contaminant what's more the same contaminant appeared in
