WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en hey you look purple I guess I should hey you look purple I guess I should hey you look purple I guess I should come clean can you smile for me eating come clean can you smile for me eating come clean can you smile for me eating my two front teeth are fake oh my god my two front teeth are fake oh my god my two front teeth are fake oh my god they're purple and fake teeth look they're purple and fake teeth look they're purple and fake teeth look different than real teeth in the different than real teeth in the different than real teeth in the ultraviolet that's crazy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] at first glance the world through a UV at first glance the world through a UV at first glance the world through a UV camera looks like a black-and-white camera looks like a black-and-white camera looks like a black-and-white version of the normal visible light version of the normal visible light version of the normal visible light world I mean these white flowers are world I mean these white flowers are world I mean these white flowers are white and UV this black towel still white and UV this black towel still white and UV this black towel still black in UV and this makes a lot of black in UV and this makes a lot of black in UV and this makes a lot of sense because ultraviolet light is very sense because ultraviolet light is very sense because ultraviolet light is very similar to visible light I mean it's similar to visible light I mean it's similar to visible light I mean it's right beside it on the electromagnetic right beside it on the electromagnetic right beside it on the electromagnetic spectrum the wavelengths are just a spectrum the wavelengths are just a spectrum the wavelengths are just a little shorter the energy per photon a little shorter the energy per photon a little shorter the energy per photon a little higher so I would expect as my little higher so I would expect as my little higher so I would expect as my first order assumption that all matter first order assumption that all matter first order assumption that all matter should interact roughly the same way should interact roughly the same way should interact roughly the same way with ultraviolet light as it does with with ultraviolet light as it does with with ultraviolet light as it does with visible light but once you take a closer visible light but once you take a closer visible light but once you take a closer look you find that the world in UV is so look you find that the world in UV is so look you find that the world in UV is so much stranger and more wonderful than much stranger and more wonderful than much stranger and more wonderful than you could have imagined for example it you could have imagined for example it you could have imagined for example it looks a lot hazy er visibility is looks a lot hazy er visibility is looks a lot hazy er visibility is reduced and clouds kind of blend in with reduced and clouds kind of blend in with reduced and clouds kind of blend in with the sky it's like there's this fog the sky it's like there's this fog the sky it's like there's this fog everywhere so why is this I want you to everywhere so why is this I want you to everywhere so why is this I want you to try to work it out before I explain it try to work it out before I explain it try to work it out before I explain it at the end of this video now take a look at the end of this video now take a look at the end of this video now take a look at these glasses in the visible part of at these glasses in the visible part of at these glasses in the visible part of the spectrum they are transparent they the spectrum they are transparent they the spectrum they are transparent they look like regular lenses but in the UV look like regular lenses but in the UV look like regular lenses but in the UV they are almost black they're absorbing they are almost black they're absorbing they are almost black they're absorbing so much ultraviolet light now take a so much ultraviolet light now take a so much ultraviolet light now take a look at this filter in the visible it look at this filter in the visible it look at this filter in the visible it looks black but now in the ultraviolet looks black but now in the ultraviolet looks black but now in the ultraviolet it looks transparent or at least it looks transparent or at least it looks transparent or at least translucent this is a UV pass filter translucent this is a UV pass filter translucent this is a UV pass filter it's absorbing all the visible light and it's absorbing all the visible light and it's absorbing all the visible light and allowing the UV to pass through it these allowing the UV to pass through it these allowing the UV to pass through it these two objects flip my intuitions about the two objects flip my intuitions about the two objects flip my intuitions about the world on their head then you come to world on their head then you come to world on their head then you come to something like this in one of these something like this in one of these something like this in one of these bottles is soda water and in the other bottles is soda water and in the other bottles is soda water and in the other is tonic water can you tell which is is tonic water can you tell which is is tonic water can you tell which is which it's pretty hard to tell just which it's pretty hard to tell just which it's pretty hard to tell just using visible light but in the using visible light but in the using visible light but in the ultraviolet it's obvious this one looks ultraviolet it's obvious this one looks ultraviolet it's obvious this one looks like Cola so why is that well it's like Cola so why is that well it's like Cola so why is that well it's because because because [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] there are some molecules in here that there are some molecules in here that there are some molecules in here that interact with ultraviolet light interact with ultraviolet light interact with ultraviolet light differently than ordinary water to differently than ordinary water to differently than ordinary water to really see what's going on we've got to really see what's going on we've got to really see what's going on we've got to take this inside same bottles take this inside same bottles take this inside same bottles ultraviolet lamp when I turn it on it's ultraviolet lamp when I turn it on it's ultraviolet lamp when I turn it on it's the tonic water that is bright whereas the tonic water that is bright whereas the tonic water that is bright whereas outside it was dark how does this make outside it was dark how does this make outside it was dark how does this make any sense well the thing is tonic water any sense well the thing is tonic water any sense well the thing is tonic water contains the quinine molecule which was contains the quinine molecule which was contains the quinine molecule which was originally a preventive medicine against originally a preventive medicine against originally a preventive medicine against malaria but it tasted so bitter that malaria but it tasted so bitter that malaria but it tasted so bitter that people mixed it with sugar water and people mixed it with sugar water and people mixed it with sugar water and made a tonic made a tonic made a tonic now some people quite liked that tonic now some people quite liked that tonic now some people quite liked that tonic but the thing about the quinine molecule but the thing about the quinine molecule but the thing about the quinine molecule is that it flores's meaning that it is that it flores's meaning that it is that it flores's meaning that it absorbs ultraviolet light and reradiates absorbs ultraviolet light and reradiates absorbs ultraviolet light and reradiates it as visible light and that's why in it as visible light and that's why in it as visible light and that's why in here it looks like it's glowing but here it looks like it's glowing but here it looks like it's glowing but outside what we're looking at it in the outside what we're looking at it in the outside what we're looking at it in the ultraviolet it looks dark because it is ultraviolet it looks dark because it is ultraviolet it looks dark because it is absorbing that ultraviolet energy and absorbing that ultraviolet energy and absorbing that ultraviolet energy and there are some other products that have there are some other products that have there are some other products that have fluorescent molecules in them often fluorescent molecules in them often fluorescent molecules in them often laundry detergents so I'm gonna try this laundry detergents so I'm gonna try this laundry detergents so I'm gonna try this one out does it look any different face one out does it look any different face one out does it look any different face basically look the same one of the ideas basically look the same one of the ideas basically look the same one of the ideas with laundry detergent is to make things with laundry detergent is to make things with laundry detergent is to make things look really bright really white by look really bright really white by look really bright really white by absorbing wavelengths that you can't see absorbing wavelengths that you can't see absorbing wavelengths that you can't see like ultraviolet and then re radiating like ultraviolet and then re radiating like ultraviolet and then re radiating them in the visible part of the spectrum them in the visible part of the spectrum them in the visible part of the spectrum which in fact makes them look much which in fact makes them look much which in fact makes them look much darker in the ultraviolet because they darker in the ultraviolet because they darker in the ultraviolet because they are absorbing that energy to re radiate are absorbing that energy to re radiate are absorbing that energy to re radiate it in the visible now if you're trying it in the visible now if you're trying it in the visible now if you're trying to find things that look different in to find things that look different in to find things that look different in ultraviolet light as opposed to visible ultraviolet light as opposed to visible ultraviolet light as opposed to visible light light light well flowers are a really good place to well flowers are a really good place to well flowers are a really good place to start because bees and other insects can start because bees and other insects can start because bees and other insects can see ultraviolet light and so plants have see ultraviolet light and so plants have see ultraviolet light and so plants have a reason to evolve pigments that they a reason to evolve pigments that they a reason to evolve pigments that they can see looking at these sunflowers you can see looking at these sunflowers you can see looking at these sunflowers you can see on the inner parts of the petals can see on the inner parts of the petals can see on the inner parts of the petals there's actually this really dark there's actually this really dark there's actually this really dark pigment in the ultraviolet it's almost pigment in the ultraviolet it's almost pigment in the ultraviolet it's almost black but you can't tell that at all black but you can't tell that at all black but you can't tell that at all just looking with your eyes the way just looking with your eyes the way just looking with your eyes the way these pigments work is that they are these pigments work is that they are these pigments work is that they are molecules that have energy transitions molecules that have energy transitions molecules that have energy transitions which correspond to the energy of an which correspond to the energy of an which correspond to the energy of an ultraviolet photon so a UV photon comes ultraviolet photon so a UV photon comes ultraviolet photon so a UV photon comes in hits an electron and excites it up to in hits an electron and excites it up to in hits an electron and excites it up to a higher energy level and then the a higher energy level and then the a higher energy level and then the electron can actually die excite in electron can actually die excite in electron can actually die excite in these molecules by transferring its these molecules by transferring its these molecules by transferring its energy to the energy to the energy to the molecule to the bonds in that molecule molecule to the bonds in that molecule molecule to the bonds in that molecule causing them to bend and vibrate and causing them to bend and vibrate and causing them to bend and vibrate and stretch so effectively it's transferring stretch so effectively it's transferring stretch so effectively it's transferring the UV energy into thermal energy and the UV energy into thermal energy and the UV energy into thermal energy and ultimately to heat our skin has ultimately to heat our skin has ultimately to heat our skin has molecules that do the same thing molecules that do the same thing molecules that do the same thing specifically melanin and I'm bringing in specifically melanin and I'm bringing in specifically melanin and I'm bringing in Diana the physics girl who has been Diana the physics girl who has been Diana the physics girl who has been filming this video with me because she filming this video with me because she filming this video with me because she knows a lot about melanin oh yeah knows a lot about melanin oh yeah knows a lot about melanin oh yeah because I'm so tan right so your your because I'm so tan right so your your because I'm so tan right so your your body wants to protect itself against UV body wants to protect itself against UV body wants to protect itself against UV rays and so there's some cells in your rays and so there's some cells in your rays and so there's some cells in your skin called melanocytes that produce skin called melanocytes that produce skin called melanocytes that produce more melanin when UV rays hit your skin more melanin when UV rays hit your skin more melanin when UV rays hit your skin and that melanin absorbs a lot of and that melanin absorbs a lot of and that melanin absorbs a lot of visible light so it looks darker in the visible light so it looks darker in the visible light so it looks darker in the visible which is why when you have more visible which is why when you have more visible which is why when you have more melanin you look more tin exactly melanin you look more tin exactly melanin you look more tin exactly melanin actually absorbs even better in melanin actually absorbs even better in melanin actually absorbs even better in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum the ultraviolet part of the spectrum the ultraviolet part of the spectrum that's where its peak is and so our skin that's where its peak is and so our skin that's where its peak is and so our skin looks darker in the ultraviolet camera looks darker in the ultraviolet camera looks darker in the ultraviolet camera than it does in the regular visible than it does in the regular visible than it does in the regular visible camera yeah what I find so amazing is camera yeah what I find so amazing is camera yeah what I find so amazing is that these melanin molecules are that these melanin molecules are that these melanin molecules are transported inside the cell to the transported inside the cell to the transported inside the cell to the nucleus forming this protective cap over nucleus forming this protective cap over nucleus forming this protective cap over the place where the DNA is stored and the place where the DNA is stored and the place where the DNA is stored and that way they prevent ultraviolet light that way they prevent ultraviolet light that way they prevent ultraviolet light from penetrating into the nucleus and from penetrating into the nucleus and from penetrating into the nucleus and causing damage to the DNA but you know causing damage to the DNA but you know causing damage to the DNA but you know one thing I think was really interesting one thing I think was really interesting one thing I think was really interesting looking at your face in the UV how do I looking at your face in the UV how do I looking at your face in the UV how do I put this I mean your skin is so clear put this I mean your skin is so clear put this I mean your skin is so clear and beautiful the visible part inspector and beautiful the visible part inspector and beautiful the visible part inspector yeah bring it on so what is surprising yeah bring it on so what is surprising yeah bring it on so what is surprising is how you can see a lot more contrast is how you can see a lot more contrast is how you can see a lot more contrast maybe some freckles that I didn't even maybe some freckles that I didn't even maybe some freckles that I didn't even know we're there it is surprising no but know we're there it is surprising no but know we're there it is surprising no but it's true i I mean I noticed that on it's true i I mean I noticed that on it's true i I mean I noticed that on yours as well think there's a bit around yours as well think there's a bit around yours as well think there's a bit around your eyes there are spots your eyes there are spots your eyes there are spots I can't notice just looking at you in I can't notice just looking at you in I can't notice just looking at you in the visible spectrum and then and then the visible spectrum and then and then the visible spectrum and then and then they pop right out when you're looking they pop right out when you're looking they pop right out when you're looking through a UV camera and you know some through a UV camera and you know some through a UV camera and you know some animals that also absorb UV I don't harp animals that also absorb UV I don't harp animals that also absorb UV I don't harp seal pups so in the Arctic when they're seal pups so in the Arctic when they're seal pups so in the Arctic when they're very specific it is but when they're very specific it is but when they're very specific it is but when they're trying to do aerial surveys and take trying to do aerial surveys and take trying to do aerial surveys and take photographs of colonies of seals it's photographs of colonies of seals it's photographs of colonies of seals it's pretty easy to spot the adults because pretty easy to spot the adults because pretty easy to spot the adults because they are dark colored but the pups they are dark colored but the pups they are dark colored but the pups I guess being young and defenseless they I guess being young and defenseless they I guess being young and defenseless they have a kind of camouflage their fur is have a kind of camouflage their fur is have a kind of camouflage their fur is white in the biz white in the biz white in the biz part of the spectrum and so they kind of part of the spectrum and so they kind of part of the spectrum and so they kind of blend into the ice and snow but in the blend into the ice and snow but in the blend into the ice and snow but in the ultraviolet part they are absorbing a ultraviolet part they are absorbing a ultraviolet part they are absorbing a lot of that radiation lot of that radiation lot of that radiation I think the ingenious thing about this I think the ingenious thing about this I think the ingenious thing about this is it allows us to get an accurate count is it allows us to get an accurate count is it allows us to get an accurate count of harp seals right because we can count of harp seals right because we can count of harp seals right because we can count the pups to by taking photos in the the pups to by taking photos in the the pups to by taking photos in the ultraviolet so this is actually one of ultraviolet so this is actually one of ultraviolet so this is actually one of the uses of ultraviolet photography you the uses of ultraviolet photography you the uses of ultraviolet photography you can also look for arctic foxes or polar can also look for arctic foxes or polar can also look for arctic foxes or polar bears bears bears using the same technique because they to using the same technique because they to using the same technique because they to absorb ultraviolet and that makes so absorb ultraviolet and that makes so absorb ultraviolet and that makes so much sense because these ultraviolet much sense because these ultraviolet much sense because these ultraviolet rays have high enough energy that they rays have high enough energy that they rays have high enough energy that they can do damage to your DNA and cause can do damage to your DNA and cause can do damage to your DNA and cause cancers and other diseases so what cancers and other diseases so what cancers and other diseases so what should you do if you are in an should you do if you are in an should you do if you are in an environment with a lot of Sun as we are environment with a lot of Sun as we are environment with a lot of Sun as we are but maybe you are not evolved for this but maybe you are not evolved for this but maybe you are not evolved for this kind of climate yeah I would say if you kind of climate yeah I would say if you kind of climate yeah I would say if you can't find some shade put on sunscreen can't find some shade put on sunscreen can't find some shade put on sunscreen it's kind of like putting melanin over it's kind of like putting melanin over it's kind of like putting melanin over the top of your skin yeah I mean the the the top of your skin yeah I mean the the the top of your skin yeah I mean the the active ingredients in sunscreen aren't active ingredients in sunscreen aren't active ingredients in sunscreen aren't melanin but they do effectively the same melanin but they do effectively the same melanin but they do effectively the same thing they take ultraviolet light and thing they take ultraviolet light and thing they take ultraviolet light and they convert it into thermal energy into they convert it into thermal energy into they convert it into thermal energy into heat right right I mean a lot a lot of heat right right I mean a lot a lot of heat right right I mean a lot a lot of ingredients in sunscreens some actually ingredients in sunscreens some actually ingredients in sunscreens some actually reflect ultraviolet as well but a lot of reflect ultraviolet as well but a lot of reflect ultraviolet as well but a lot of active ingredients in sunscreen absorb active ingredients in sunscreen absorb active ingredients in sunscreen absorb ultraviolet light and change it into ultraviolet light and change it into ultraviolet light and change it into heat this is what it looks like if you heat this is what it looks like if you heat this is what it looks like if you don't go outside in the Sun very much I don't go outside in the Sun very much I don't go outside in the Sun very much I just use sunscreen is that right is that just use sunscreen is that right is that just use sunscreen is that right is that right well not every day but I remember right well not every day but I remember right well not every day but I remember my mom was like you sounds green I'm my mom was like you sounds green I'm my mom was like you sounds green I'm like okay so why does the world look so like okay so why does the world look so like okay so why does the world look so hazy in the ultraviolet my first thought hazy in the ultraviolet my first thought hazy in the ultraviolet my first thought was that it must be something in the was that it must be something in the was that it must be something in the atmosphere that is absorbing the atmosphere that is absorbing the atmosphere that is absorbing the ultraviolet light like pollution or just ultraviolet light like pollution or just ultraviolet light like pollution or just one of the components of our atmosphere one of the components of our atmosphere one of the components of our atmosphere but as physics girl pointed out to me if but as physics girl pointed out to me if but as physics girl pointed out to me if things were really absorbing ultraviolet things were really absorbing ultraviolet things were really absorbing ultraviolet light well the sky we look darker not light well the sky we look darker not light well the sky we look darker not light not foggy like it does and of light not foggy like it does and of light not foggy like it does and of course if you do look at the absorption course if you do look at the absorption course if you do look at the absorption spectra of the common atmospheric spectra of the common atmospheric spectra of the common atmospheric molecules you'll find that virtually molecules you'll find that virtually molecules you'll find that virtually nothing absorbs in the UV so what is nothing absorbs in the UV so what is nothing absorbs in the UV so what is going on well the answer is Rayleigh going on well the answer is Rayleigh going on well the answer is Rayleigh scattering the same phenomenon that scattering the same phenomenon that scattering the same phenomenon that makes our sky blue is responsible for makes our sky blue is responsible for makes our sky blue is responsible for the reduced visibility this foggy hazy the reduced visibility this foggy hazy the reduced visibility this foggy hazy appearance in the UV the shorter the appearance in the UV the shorter the appearance in the UV the shorter the wavelength of light the more likely it wavelength of light the more likely it wavelength of light the more likely it is to bow is to bow is to bow soft tiny molecules in our atmosphere soft tiny molecules in our atmosphere soft tiny molecules in our atmosphere and scatter in all directions so when we and scatter in all directions so when we and scatter in all directions so when we look up we are actually seeing a blue look up we are actually seeing a blue look up we are actually seeing a blue haze blocking out space it's a really haze blocking out space it's a really haze blocking out space it's a really cool way of thinking about the blue sky cool way of thinking about the blue sky cool way of thinking about the blue sky rally scattering is inversely rally scattering is inversely rally scattering is inversely proportional to the wavelength of light proportional to the wavelength of light proportional to the wavelength of light to the power of four so it really to the power of four so it really to the power of four so it really strongly increases this shorter the strongly increases this shorter the strongly increases this shorter the wavelength becomes in fact there's about wavelength becomes in fact there's about wavelength becomes in fact there's about five times as much scattering of five times as much scattering of five times as much scattering of ultraviolet light than there is a ultraviolet light than there is a ultraviolet light than there is a visible light in the middle of the visible light in the middle of the visible light in the middle of the spectrum so you know if we could see spectrum so you know if we could see spectrum so you know if we could see ultraviolet light we might look up and ultraviolet light we might look up and ultraviolet light we might look up and ask not why is the sky blue but why is ask not why is the sky blue but why is ask not why is the sky blue but why is the sky ultraviolet and this is I think the sky ultraviolet and this is I think the sky ultraviolet and this is I think the amazing thing about seeing in the the amazing thing about seeing in the the amazing thing about seeing in the ultraviolet it's that it shows us how ultraviolet it's that it shows us how ultraviolet it's that it shows us how the world is not how we perceive it to the world is not how we perceive it to the world is not how we perceive it to be there's so much more going on there be there's so much more going on there be there's so much more going on there than we would ever imagined oh my gosh than we would ever imagined oh my gosh than we would ever imagined oh my gosh oh that's very interesting you know I oh that's very interesting you know I oh that's very interesting you know I want more of this you know it's one want more of this you know it's one want more of this you know it's one thing to know the way the world works thing to know the way the world works thing to know the way the world works but it's another to see it so you're but it's another to see it so you're but it's another to see it so you're doing a video on different SPFs and all doing a video on different SPFs and all doing a video on different SPFs and all the sunscreen controversies on your the sunscreen controversies on your the sunscreen controversies on your channel yes I'm talking about whether channel yes I'm talking about whether channel yes I'm talking about whether SPF sunscreen look different with a UV SPF sunscreen look different with a UV SPF sunscreen look different with a UV camera why SPF labeling is so weird and camera why SPF labeling is so weird and camera why SPF labeling is so weird and why the FDA has proposed rules years ago why the FDA has proposed rules years ago why the FDA has proposed rules years ago we still have figured out how to label we still have figured out how to label we still have figured out how to label sunscreens it is contra yeah awesome so sunscreens it is contra yeah awesome so sunscreens it is contra yeah awesome so I'll put a link to Diana's video you I'll put a link to Diana's video you I'll put a link to Diana's video you should go check it out also the how to should go check it out also the how to should go check it out also the how to make everything guys have made sunscreen make everything guys have made sunscreen make everything guys have made sunscreen they've made sunscreen I haven't seen it they've made sunscreen I haven't seen it they've made sunscreen I haven't seen it yet but I will put a link to their video yet but I will put a link to their video yet but I will put a link to their video so you can go check that out as well why so you can go check that out as well why so you can go check that out as well why is this fly only attacking me cuz I'm is this fly only attacking me cuz I'm is this fly only attacking me cuz I'm wearing sunscreen it likes the smelly oh wearing sunscreen it likes the smelly oh wearing sunscreen it likes the smelly oh yeah
