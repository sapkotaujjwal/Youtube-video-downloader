WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en There is a hole at the bottom of math a hole that&nbsp; means we will never know everything with certainty There will always be true statements that&nbsp; cannot be proven. Now no one knows what those statements are exactly but they could&nbsp;be something like the Twin Prime Conjecture. Twin primes are prime numbers that are separated&nbsp; by just one number like 11 and 13, or 17 and 19. And as you go up the number line primes occur less&nbsp; frequently and twin primes are rarer still. But the Twin Prime Conjecture is that there are infinitely&nbsp; many twin primes. You never run out them. As of right now no one has proven this conjecture true or false. But the crazy thing is this: we may never know because what has been proven is that in any system&nbsp; of mathematics where you can do basic arithmetic there will always be true statements&nbsp; that are impossible to prove. That is life. Specifically this is the Game of Life,&nbsp; created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway Sadly he passed away in 2020 from covet&nbsp; 19. Conway's game of life is played on an infinite grid of square cells each of which is&nbsp; either live or dead and there are only two rules one any dead cell with exactly three neighbors&nbsp; comes to life and two any living cell with less than two or more than three neighbors dies once&nbsp; you've set up the initial arrangement of cells the two rules are applied to create the&nbsp; next generation and then the one after that and the one after that and so on it's totally&nbsp; automatic Conway called it a zero player game but even though the rules are simple the game&nbsp; itself can generate a wide variety of behavior some patterns are stable once they arise they&nbsp; never change others oscillate back and forth in a loop a few can travel across the grid forever like&nbsp; this glider here many patterns just fizzle out but a few keep growing forever&nbsp; they keep generating new cells now you would think that given the&nbsp; simple rules of the game you could just look at any pattern and determine what will happen&nbsp; to it will it eventually reach a steady state or will it keep growing without limit but it&nbsp; turns out this question is impossible to answer the ultimate fate of a pattern in Conway's&nbsp; game of life is undecidable meaning there is no possible algorithm that is guaranteed to&nbsp; answer the question in a finite amount of time you could always just try running the pattern and&nbsp; see what happens i mean the rules of the game are a kind of algorithm after all but that's not&nbsp; guaranteed to give you an answer either because even if you run it for a million generations&nbsp; you won't be able to say whether it'll last forever or just 2 million generations&nbsp; or a billion or a googleplex is there something special about the game of life&nbsp; that makes it undecidable nope there are actually a huge number of systems that are undecidable&nbsp; like Wang tiles quantum physics airline ticketing systems and even magic the gathering to understand&nbsp; how undecidability shows up in all of these places we have to go back 150 years to a&nbsp; full-blown revolt in mathematics in 1874 Georg Cantor a german mathematician&nbsp; published a paper that launched a new branch of mathematics called set theory a set is&nbsp; just a well-defined collection of things so the two shoes on your feet are a set as are&nbsp; all the planetariums in the world there's a set with nothing in it the empty set and a set with&nbsp; everything in it now Cantor was thinking about sets of numbers like natural numbers positive&nbsp; integers like 1 2 3 4 and so on and real numbers which include fractions like a third five&nbsp; halves and also irrational numbers like pi e and the square root of two basically any number&nbsp; that can be represented as an infinite decimal he wondered are there more natural numbers&nbsp; or more real numbers between zero and one the answer might seem obvious there are&nbsp; an infinite number of each so both sets should be the same size but to check this logic&nbsp; canter imagined writing down an infinite list matching up each natural number on one side with&nbsp; a real number between zero and one on the other now since each real number is an infinite decimal&nbsp; there is no first one so we can just write them down in any random order the key is to make sure&nbsp; we get them all with no duplicates and line them up one to one with an integer if we can do that&nbsp; with none left over well then we know that the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers&nbsp; between 0 and 1 are the same size so assume we've done that we have a complete infinite list with&nbsp; each integer acting like an index number a unique identifier for each real number on the list now&nbsp; Cantor says start writing down a new real number and the way we're going to do it is by taking the&nbsp; first digit of the first number and adding one then take the second digit of the second number&nbsp; and again add one take the third digit of the third number add one and keep doing this all the&nbsp; way down the list if the digit is a nine just roll it back to an eight and by the end of this process&nbsp; you'll have a real number between zero and one but here's the thing this number won't appear anywhere&nbsp; on our list it's different from the first number in the first decimal place different from the&nbsp; second number in the second decimal place and so on down the line it has to be different from&nbsp; every number on the list by at least one digit the number on the diagonal that's why this&nbsp; is called Cantor's diagonalization proof it shows there must be more real numbers between&nbsp; 0 and 1 then there are natural numbers extending out to infinity so not all infinities are the same&nbsp; size Cantor call these countable and uncountable infinities respectively and in fact there are many&nbsp; more uncountable infinities which are even larger now Cantor's work was just the latest blow to&nbsp; mathematics for 2000 years Euclid's elements were considered the bedrock of the discipline but&nbsp; at the turn of the 19th century Lobashevsky and gauss discovered non-Euclidean geometries and&nbsp; this prompted mathematicians to examine more closely the foundations of their field and they&nbsp; did not like what they saw the idea of a limit at the heart of calculus turned out to be poorly&nbsp; defined and now Cantor was showing that infinity itself was much more complex than anyone had&nbsp; imagined in all this upheaval mathematics fractured and a huge debate broke out among&nbsp; mathematicians at the end of the 1800s on the one side were the intuitionists who thought that&nbsp; Cantor's work was nonsense they were convinced that math was a pure creation of the human mind&nbsp; and that infinities like Cantors weren't real Henri Poincaré said that later generations will&nbsp; regard set theory as a disease from which one has recovered Leopold Kronecker called Cantor a&nbsp; scientific charlatan and a corrupter of the youth and he worked to keep Cantor from getting a job&nbsp; he wanted on the other side were the formalists they thought that math could be put on absolutely&nbsp; secure logical foundations through Cantor's set theory the informal leader of the formalists&nbsp; was the german mathematician David Hilbert Hilbert was a living legend a hugely influential&nbsp; mathematician who had worked in nearly every area of mathematics he almost beat Einstein to the&nbsp; punch on general relativity he developed entirely new mathematical concepts that were crucial for&nbsp; quantum mechanics and he knew that Cantor's work was brilliant Hilbert was convinced that a more&nbsp; formal and rigorous system of mathematical proof based on set theory could solve all the issues&nbsp; that had cropped up in math over the last century and most other mathematicians agreed with him no&nbsp; one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created Hilbert declared but in 1901 Bertrand&nbsp; Russell pointed out a serious problem in Cantor's set theory Russell knew that if sets can contain&nbsp; anything they can contain other sets or even themselves for example the set of all sets must&nbsp; contain itself as does the set of sets with more than five elements in them you could even talk&nbsp; about the set of all sets that contain themselves but this leads straight to a problem what about r&nbsp; the set of all sets that don't contain themselves if r doesn't contain itself well then it must&nbsp; contain itself but if r does contain itself then by definition it must not contain itself so r&nbsp; contains itself if and only if it doesn't Russell had found another paradox of self-reference and&nbsp; he later explained his paradox using a hairy analogy let's say there's a village populated&nbsp; entirely by grown men with a strange law against beards specifically the law states that the&nbsp; village barber must shave all and only those men of the village who do not shave themselves but the&nbsp; barber himself lives in the village too of course and he's a man so who shaves him if he doesn't&nbsp; shave himself then the barber has to shave him but the barber can't shave himself because the&nbsp; barber doesn't shave anyone who shaves themselves so the barber must shave himself if and only if&nbsp; he doesn't shave himself it's a contradiction the intuitionists rejoiced at Russell's&nbsp; paradox thinking it had proven set theory hopelessly flawed but zermelo and other&nbsp; mathematicians from Hilbert school solved the problem by restricting the concept of&nbsp; a set so the collection of all sets for example is not a set anymore and neither is the collection&nbsp; of all sets which don't contain themselves this eliminated the paradoxes that&nbsp; come with self-reference Hilbert and the formalists lived to fight another day but&nbsp; self-reference refused to die quite that easily fast forward to the 1960s and mathematician Hao&nbsp; Wang was looking at square tiles with different colors on each side like these the rules were&nbsp; that touching edges must be the same color and you can't rotate or reflect tiles only slide&nbsp; them around the question was if you're given an arbitrary set of these tiles can you tell if they&nbsp; will tile the plane that is will they connect up with no gaps all the way out to infinity it&nbsp; turns out you can't tell for an arbitrary set of tiles whether they will tile the plane or not&nbsp; the problem is undecidable just like the fate of a pattern in Conway's game of life in fact&nbsp; it's exactly the same problem and that problem ultimately comes from self-reference as Hilbert&nbsp; and the formalists were about to discover Hilbert wanted to secure the foundations of&nbsp; mathematics by developing a new system for mathematical proofs systems of proof were an old&nbsp; idea going back to the ancient greeks a system of proof starts with axioms basic statements that&nbsp; are assumed to be true like a straight line can be drawn between any two points proofs are then&nbsp; constructed from those axioms using rules of inference methods for using existing statements&nbsp; to derive new statements and these are chosen to preserve truth the existing statements are true&nbsp; then so are the new ones Hilbert wanted a formal system of proof a symbolic logical language with a&nbsp; rigid set of manipulation rules for those symbols logical and mathematical statements could then&nbsp; be translated into this system if you drop a book then it will fall would be a then b and no&nbsp; human is immortal would be expressed like this Hilbert and the formalists wanted to express&nbsp; the axioms of mathematics as symbolic statements in a formal system and set up the rules&nbsp; of inference as the system's rules for symbol manipulation so Russell&nbsp; along with Alfred North Whitehead developed a formal system like this in&nbsp; their three-volume Principia Mathematica published in 1913. Principia Mathematica is vast a&nbsp; total of nearly 2 000 pages of dense mathematical notation it takes 762 pages just to get to a&nbsp; complete proof that one plus one equals two at which point Russell and Whitehead dryly note&nbsp; the above proposition is occasionally useful the authors had originally planned&nbsp; a fourth volume but unsurprisingly they were too worn out to complete it so yes&nbsp; the notation is dense and exhausting but it is also exact unlike ordinary languages it leaves&nbsp; no room for errors or fuzzy logic to creep in and most importantly it allows you to prove&nbsp; properties of the formal system itself there were three big questions that&nbsp; Hilbert wanted answered about mathematics number one is math complete meaning is there a&nbsp; way to prove every true statement does every true statement have a proof number two is mathematics&nbsp; consistent meaning is it free of contradictions i mean if you can simultaneously prove a and not&nbsp; a then that's a real problem because you can prove anything at all and number three is math&nbsp; decidable meaning is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows&nbsp; from the axioms now Hilbert was convinced that the answers to all three of these questions was&nbsp; yes at a major conference in 1930 Hilbert gave a fiery speech about these questions he ended it&nbsp; with a line that summed up his formalist dream in opposition to the foolish ignorabimus which means we&nbsp; will not know our slogan shall be we must know we will know these words are literally on his grave&nbsp; but by the time Hilbert gave this speech his dream was already crumbling just the day before at a&nbsp; small meeting at the same conference a 24 year old logician named Kurt Gödel explained that he had&nbsp; found the answer to the first of Hilbert's three big questions about completeness and the answer&nbsp; was no a complete formal system of mathematics was impossible the only person who paid much&nbsp; attention was John von Neumann one of Hilbert's former students who pulled Gödel aside to ask a&nbsp; few questions but the next year Gödel published a proof of his incompleteness theorem and this&nbsp; time everyone including Hilbert took notice this is how Gödel's proof works Gödel&nbsp; wanted to use logic and mathematics to answer questions about the very system&nbsp; of logic and mathematics and so he took all these basic symbols of a mathematical&nbsp; system and then he gave each one a number this is known as the symbol's Gödel number&nbsp; so the symbol for not gets the number one or has the Gödel number two if then it's Gödel&nbsp; number three now if you're expressing all of these symbols with numbers then what do you do about&nbsp; the numbers themselves well zero gets its own Gödel number six and if you want to write a one&nbsp; you just put this successor symbol next to it the immediate successor of zero is 1. and if you&nbsp; want to write 2 then you have to write ss0 and that represents 2 and so on so you could&nbsp; represent any positive integer this way granted it is cumbersome but it works&nbsp; and that is the point of this system so now that we have Gödel numbers for all of&nbsp; the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might want to use we can start to write equations&nbsp; like we could write zero equals zero so these symbols have the Gödel numbers six five six and&nbsp; we can actually create a new card that represents this equation zero equals zero and the way we&nbsp; do it is we take the prime numbers starting at 2 and we raise each one to the power of the Gödel&nbsp; number of the symbol in our equation so we have 2 to the power of 6 times 3 to the power of 5&nbsp; times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million so 243 million is the Gödel number&nbsp; of the whole equation zero equals zero we can write down Gödel numbers for&nbsp; any set of symbols that you can imagine so really this is an infinite deck of cards where&nbsp; any set of symbols that you want to write down in a sequence you can represent with a unique&nbsp; Gödel number and the beauty of this Gödel number is you can do a prime factorization of it&nbsp; and you can work out exactly what symbols made up this card so in this whole pack of cards&nbsp; there are going to be true statements and there are going to be false statements so how&nbsp; do you prove that something is true well you need to go to the axioms the axioms also have their own&nbsp; Gödel numbers which are formed in the same way so here's an axiom which says not the successor of&nbsp; any number x equals zero which makes sense because in this system there are no negative numbers and&nbsp; so the successor of any number cannot be zero so we can put down this axiom and then we can&nbsp; substitute in zero for x saying that one does not equal zero and we've created a proof this is the&nbsp; simplest proof i can think of that shows that one does not equal zero now this card for the proof of&nbsp; one does not equal zero gets its own Gödel number and the way we calculate this Gödel number&nbsp; is just as before we take the prime numbers and we raise 2 to the power of the axiom times&nbsp; 3 to the power of 1 does not equal 0 and we get a tremendously large number it would have 73&nbsp; million digits if you calculated it all out so i've just left it here in exponential notation as&nbsp; you can see these numbers get very large and so you might want to start just calling them by&nbsp; letters so we could say this one is Gödel number a this is Gödel number b Gödel number&nbsp; c and so on Gödel goes to all this trouble to find this card which says there is no proof for the&nbsp; statement with Gödel number g the trick is that the Gödel number of this card is&nbsp; g so what this statement is really saying is this card is unprovable there is no proof&nbsp; anywhere in our infinite deck for this card now think about it if it's&nbsp; false and there is a proof then what you have just proven is there is&nbsp; no proof so you're stuck with a contradiction that would mean the mathematical system is&nbsp; inconsistent the other alternative is that this card is true there is no proof for the&nbsp; statement with Gödel number g but that means this mathematical system has true statements&nbsp; in it that have no proof so your mathematical system is incomplete and that is Gödel's&nbsp; incompleteness theorem this is how he shows that any basic mathematical system that can do&nbsp; fundamental arithmetic will always have statements within it which are true but which have no proof&nbsp; there's a line in the tv show the office that echoes the self-referential paradox of Gödel's&nbsp; proof jim is my enemy but it turns out the jim is also his own worst enemy and the enemy of my&nbsp; enemy is my friend so jim is actually my friend but because he is his own worst enemy the enemy of my friend is my enemy so&nbsp; actually jim is my enemy but Gödel's incompleteness theorem means that&nbsp; truth and provability are not at all the same thing Hilbert was wrong there will always be true&nbsp; statements about mathematics that just cannot be proven now Hilbert could console himself with&nbsp; the hope that at least we could still prove maths consistent that is free of contradictions&nbsp; but then Gödel published his second incompleteness theorem in which he showed&nbsp; that any consistent formal system of math cannot prove its own consistency so taken together&nbsp; Gödel's two incompleteness theorems say that the best you can hope for is a consistent yet&nbsp; incomplete system of math but a system like that cannot prove its own consistency so some&nbsp; contradiction could always crop up in the future revealing that the system you'd been working with&nbsp; had been inconsistent the whole time and that leaves only the third and final big question from&nbsp; Hilbert is mathematics decidable that is is there an algorithm that can always determine whether&nbsp; a statement follows from the axioms and in 1936 Alan Turing found a way to settle this question&nbsp; but to do it he had to invent the modern computer in his time computers weren't machines&nbsp; they were people often women who carried out long and tedious calculations Turing&nbsp; imagined an entirely mechanical computer he wanted it to be powerful enough to perform any&nbsp; computation imaginable but simple enough that you could reason through its operation so he came up&nbsp; with a machine that takes as input an infinitely long tape of square cells each containing a zero&nbsp; or a one the machine has a read write head that can read one digit at a time then it can perform&nbsp; one of only a few tasks overwrite a new value move left move right or simply halt&nbsp; halting means the program has run to completion the program consists of a set of&nbsp; internal instructions you can think of it like a flow chart that tells the machine what to do&nbsp; based on the digit it reads and its internal state you could imagine exporting these instructions to&nbsp; any other Turing machine which would then perform in exactly the same way as the first although&nbsp; this sounds simple a Turing machine's arbitrarily large memory and program mean it can execute any&nbsp; computable algorithm if given enough time from addition and subtraction to the entire youtube&nbsp; algorithm it can do anything a modern computer can that's what made the Turing machine so useful in&nbsp; answering Hilbert's question on decidability when a touring machine halts the program has finished&nbsp; running and the tape is the output but sometimes a touring machine never halts maybe it gets stuck in&nbsp; an infinite loop is it possible to tell beforehand if a program will halt or not on a particular&nbsp; input Turing realized this halting problem was very similar to the decidability problem if&nbsp; he could find a way to figure out if a Turing machine would halt then it would also be possible&nbsp; to decide if a statement followed from the axioms for example you could solve the twin prime&nbsp; conjecture by writing a Turing machine program that starts with the axioms and constructs&nbsp; all theorems that can be produced in one step using the rules of inference then it constructs&nbsp; all theorems that can be produced in one step from those and so on each time it generates a&nbsp; new theorem it checks if it's the twin prime conjecture and if it is it halts if not it never&nbsp; halts so if you could solve the halting problem you could solve the twin prime conjecture&nbsp; and all sorts of other unsolved questions so Turing said let's assume we can make a&nbsp; machine h that can determine whether any Turing machine will halt or not on a particular&nbsp; input you insert the program and its input and h simulates what will happen printing out&nbsp; either halts or never halts for now we don't worry about how h works we just know that it always&nbsp; works it always gives you the right answer now we can modify the h machine by adding additional&nbsp; components one if it receives the output halts immediately goes into an infinite loop another if&nbsp; it receives never holds then it immediately halts we can call this entire new machine h plus and&nbsp; we can export the program for that entire machine now what happens if we give this machine&nbsp; its own code both as program and input well now h is simulating what h plus&nbsp; would do given its own input essentially h has to determine the behavior of a machine&nbsp; that it itself is a part of in this exact circumstance if h concludes that h plus never&nbsp; halts well this makes h plus immediately halt if h thinks h plus will halt well then&nbsp; that necessarily forces h plus to loop whatever output the halting machine h gives it&nbsp; turns out to be wrong there's a contradiction the only explanation can be that a machine like&nbsp; h can't exist there's no way to tell in general if a touring machine will halt or not on a given&nbsp; input and this means mathematics is undecidable there is no algorithm that can always determine&nbsp; whether a statement is derivable from the axioms so something like the twin prime conjecture&nbsp; might be unsolvable we might never know whether there are infinite twin primes or not&nbsp; the problem of undecidability even crops up in physical systems in quantum mechanics one&nbsp; of the most important properties of a many-body system is the difference in energy between&nbsp; its ground state and its first excited state this is known as the spectral gap some systems&nbsp; have a significant spectral gap whereas others are gapless there are a continuum of energy levels&nbsp; all the way down to the ground state and this is important because at low temperatures gapless&nbsp; quantum systems can undergo phase transitions while gapped systems cannot they don't have&nbsp; the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap but figuring out if a system is gapped or gapless&nbsp; has long been known to be a very difficult problem only recently in 2015 did mathematicians&nbsp; prove that in general the spectral gap question is undecidable to quote the authors even a&nbsp; perfect complete description of the microscopic interactions between a material's particles is not&nbsp; always enough to deduce its macroscopic properties now remember that Turing designed his machines to&nbsp; be as powerful computers as it is possible to make to this day the best computational systems are&nbsp; those that can do everything a touring machine can this is called touring completeness and it turns&nbsp; out there are many such during complete systems although they are powerful every touring complete&nbsp; system comes with a catch its own analog of the halting problem some undecidable property of&nbsp; the system Wang tiles are touring complete their halting problem is whether or not they'll tile the&nbsp; plane complex quantum systems are Turing complete and their halting problem is the spectral gap&nbsp; question and the game of life is Turing complete its halting problem is literally whether or&nbsp; not it halts there are many more examples of this like airline ticketing systems magic the&nbsp; gathering powerpoint slides and excel spreadsheets nearly every programming language in existence is&nbsp; designed to be Turing complete but in theory we only need one programming language because&nbsp; well you can program anything at all using any Turing complete system so here's a touring&nbsp; machine inside the game of life and since the game of life is itself touring complete it should&nbsp; be capable of simulating itself and indeed it is this is the game of life&nbsp; running on the game of life the real legacy of David Hilbert's dream&nbsp; is all of our modern computational devices Kurt Gödel suffered bouts of mental instability&nbsp; later in life convinced that people were trying to poison him he refused to eat eventually&nbsp; starving himself to death Hilbert died in 1943 his epitaph was his slogan from 1930. we must know&nbsp; we will know the truth is we don't know sometimes we can't know but in trying to find out we can&nbsp; discover new things things that change the world Alan Turing put his ideas about computing to&nbsp; practical use in world war ii leading the team at Bletchley Park that built real calculating&nbsp; machines to crack nazi codes for the allies by one estimate the intelligence Turing and&nbsp; his colleagues gathered from decrypted messages shortened the war by two to four years after&nbsp; the war Turing and John von Neumann designed the first true programmable electronic&nbsp; computer eniac based on touring's designs but Turing didn't live to see&nbsp; his ideas develop much further in 1952 the british government convicted him of&nbsp; gross indecency upon learning he was gay he was stripped of his security clearance and forced&nbsp; to take hormones in 1954 he committed suicide touring changed the world he is widely&nbsp; considered to be the most important founding figure in computer science all modern&nbsp; computers are descended from his designs but touring's ideas about computability&nbsp; came from his concept of the Turing machine which came from thinking about Hilbert's question&nbsp; is math decidable so touring's code breaking machines and indeed all modern computers stem from&nbsp; the weird paradoxes that arise from self-reference there is a hole at the bottom of math a hole that&nbsp; means we will never know everything with certainty there will always be true&nbsp; statements that cannot be proven and you might think this realization&nbsp; would have driven mathematicians mad and led to the disintegration of the entire&nbsp; mathematical enterprise but instead thinking about this problem transformed the concept&nbsp; of infinity changed the course of a world war and led directly to the invention of the&nbsp; device you're watching this on right now hey this video was sponsored by brilliant a&nbsp; website full of interactive courses and quizzes that delve deep into topics like math physics and&nbsp; computer science now if you've gotten this far into this video you're likely someone who would&nbsp;
