the Sun rather than dwell on away from the Sun rather than dwell on away from the Sun rather than dwell on how you ended up here open the P bay how you ended up here open the P bay how you ended up here open the P bay doors how I'm sorry Derek I'm afraid I doors how I'm sorry Derek I'm afraid I doors how I'm sorry Derek I'm afraid I can't do that you decide to collect data can't do that you decide to collect data can't do that you decide to collect data for your Google science fair project you for your Google science fair project you for your Google science fair project you notice that as you move further away notice that as you move further away notice that as you move further away from the Sun the intensity of its light from the Sun the intensity of its light from the Sun the intensity of its light decreases and this isn't due to the decreases and this isn't due to the decreases and this isn't due to the light dying away or being absorbed it's light dying away or being absorbed it's light dying away or being absorbed it's simply due to the light energy being simply due to the light energy being simply due to the light energy being spread over more space consider the spread over more space consider the spread over more space consider the light emitted by the sun in a single light emitted by the sun in a single light emitted by the sun in a single second it's enough energy to power the second it's enough energy to power the second it's enough energy to power the whole world for a million years or to whole world for a million years or to whole world for a million years or to heat up 3,200 billion billion hot heat up 3,200 billion billion hot heat up 3,200 billion billion hot pockets as all that light travels out pockets as all that light travels out pockets as all that light travels out through space you can think of it through space you can think of it through space you can think of it spreading out over the surface of a spreading out over the surface of a spreading out over the surface of a growing sphere and since the surface growing sphere and since the surface growing sphere and since the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r s the area of a sphere is 4 pi r s the area of a sphere is 4 pi r s the intensity of light is inversely intensity of light is inversely intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of distance proportional to the square of distance proportional to the square of distance from the Sun so when you're twice as far from the Sun so when you're twice as far from the Sun so when you're twice as far away as where you started the light will away as where you started the light will away as where you started the light will be a quarter as bright and this is known be a quarter as bright and this is known be a quarter as bright and this is known as the inverse Square law so as you as the inverse Square law so as you as the inverse Square law so as you continue past the Pluto formerly known continue past the Pluto formerly known continue past the Pluto formerly known as a planet the light becomes dimmer and as a planet the light becomes dimmer and as a planet the light becomes dimmer and dimmer until it is so faint that you dimmer until it is so faint that you dimmer until it is so faint that you can't even see the sun well that's not can't even see the sun well that's not can't even see the sun well that's not terribly surprising but what if you had terribly surprising but what if you had terribly surprising but what if you had really sensitive eyes like the eyes of a really sensitive eyes like the eyes of a really sensitive eyes like the eyes of a frog well then as you move further away frog well then as you move further away frog well then as you move further away from the Sun by The in ver Square law from the Sun by The in ver Square law from the Sun by The in ver Square law you would expect to see the light you would expect to see the light you would expect to see the light decreasing in brightness but never decreasing in brightness but never decreasing in brightness but never fading out completely but that is not fading out completely but that is not fading out completely but that is not what you see at some point the sun what you see at some point the sun what you see at some point the sun begins to flicker so you see flashes of begins to flicker so you see flashes of begins to flicker so you see flashes of light separated by complete darkness and light separated by complete darkness and light separated by complete darkness and what's weirder as you continue to move what's weirder as you continue to move what's weirder as you continue to move further away the flashes would not further away the flashes would not further away the flashes would not decrease in brightness instead they decrease in brightness instead they decrease in brightness instead they merely become less frequent if you took merely become less frequent if you took merely become less frequent if you took the average of the flashes in darkness the average of the flashes in darkness the average of the flashes in darkness you would find it smoothly follows the you would find it smoothly follows the you would find it smoothly follows the curve of the inverse Square law but the curve of the inverse Square law but the curve of the inverse Square law but the light itself comes in lumps they are light itself comes in lumps they are light itself comes in lumps they are indivisible and so they can't get any indivisible and so they can't get any indivisible and so they can't get any less intense only more spread out this less intense only more spread out this less intense only more spread out this dramatically demonstrates that light is dramatically demonstrates that light is dramatically demonstrates that light is quantized meaning it always comes in quantized meaning it always comes in quantized meaning it always comes in multiples of a smallest quantity called multiples of a smallest quantity called multiples of a smallest quantity called a a a Quantum is that incredible you're making Quantum is that incredible you're making Quantum is that incredible you're making the slit narrower and yet the spot on the slit narrower and yet the spot on the slit narrower and yet the spot on the wall is getting wider the narrower the wall is getting wider the narrower the wall is getting wider the narrower you make it the wider that spot on the you make it the wider that spot on the you make it the wider that spot on the wall wall wall becomes to understand this we have to becomes to understand this we have to becomes to understand this we have to look at Heisenberg's uncertainty look at Heisenberg's uncertainty look at Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can you think of some other principle can you think of some other principle can you think of some other things that are quantized please put things that are quantized please put things that are quantized please put them in the comments and say what a them in the comments and say what a them in the comments and say what a single Quantum of that thing is I'm single Quantum of that thing is I'm single Quantum of that thing is I'm sorry Derek I'm afraid I can't do that sorry Derek I'm afraid I can't do that sorry Derek I'm afraid I can't do that for example cash money is quantized and for example cash money is quantized and for example cash money is quantized and a Quantum of money is a penny unless you a Quantum of money is a penny unless you a Quantum of money is a penny unless you live in Australia in which case we've live in Australia in which case we've live in Australia in which case we've got rid of pennies so the smallest got rid of pennies so the smallest got rid of pennies so the smallest division is 5 cents but now a lot of division is 5 cents but now a lot of division is 5 cents but now a lot of machines won't even take 5 cents so we machines won't even take 5 cents so we machines won't even take 5 cents so we should probably get rid of that too okay should probably get rid of that too okay should probably get rid of that too okay what other things can you think of
