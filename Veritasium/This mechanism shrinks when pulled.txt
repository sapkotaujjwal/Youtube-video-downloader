WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en This little mechanism shrinks when you This little mechanism shrinks when you This little mechanism shrinks when you try to stretch it. You try to pull it try to stretch it. You try to pull it try to stretch it. You try to pull it apart and all of a sudden it pulls back apart and all of a sudden it pulls back apart and all of a sudden it pulls back on you. That's so weird, right? Here it on you. That's so weird, right? Here it on you. That's so weird, right? Here it is under controlled conditions. There's is under controlled conditions. There's is under controlled conditions. There's a cup hanging from the mechanism. But a cup hanging from the mechanism. But a cup hanging from the mechanism. But now look what happens as you add water now look what happens as you add water now look what happens as you add water to it. All of a sudden, the cup shoots to it. All of a sudden, the cup shoots to it. All of a sudden, the cup shoots up. The amount it shoots up is tiny. But up. The amount it shoots up is tiny. But up. The amount it shoots up is tiny. But the physics behind it is so the physics behind it is so the physics behind it is so counterintuitive, nobody thought it was counterintuitive, nobody thought it was counterintuitive, nobody thought it was possible. It feels like it violates possible. It feels like it violates possible. It feels like it violates physics. That's why it's fun. The physics. That's why it's fun. The physics. That's why it's fun. The paradox that controls this mechanism paradox that controls this mechanism paradox that controls this mechanism governs everything from mechanical governs everything from mechanical governs everything from mechanical systems to food chains, from traffic systems to food chains, from traffic systems to food chains, from traffic jams to power grids. And to understand jams to power grids. And to understand jams to power grids. And to understand it, you just need to ask a simple it, you just need to ask a simple it, you just need to ask a simple question. What will happen to this question. What will happen to this question. What will happen to this weight if you cut the green rope? Where weight if you cut the green rope? Where weight if you cut the green rope? Where is this going to end up? Is it going to is this going to end up? Is it going to is this going to end up? Is it going to go up? Is it going to going to go down? go up? Is it going to going to go down? go up? Is it going to going to go down? Or is it going to stay the same? Or is it going to stay the same? Or is it going to stay the same? Can I touch? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can Can I touch? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can Can I touch? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can try it. Nothing. You don't think try it. Nothing. You don't think try it. Nothing. You don't think anything's going to happen? In the same anything's going to happen? In the same anything's going to happen? In the same place. Uh, weight is going to be right place. Uh, weight is going to be right place. Uh, weight is going to be right over there. Like it's going to fly off over there. Like it's going to fly off over there. Like it's going to fly off or what? No, not not too much, but or what? No, not not too much, but or what? No, not not too much, but probably it's going to go to this way. probably it's going to go to this way. probably it's going to go to this way. If you cut the green rope, this is going If you cut the green rope, this is going If you cut the green rope, this is going to come down. It will go down. It will to come down. It will go down. It will to come down. It will go down. It will go down. It drops. It'll fall down. The go down. It drops. It'll fall down. The go down. It drops. It'll fall down. The first thing that occurs to me is as soon first thing that occurs to me is as soon first thing that occurs to me is as soon as you cut that, the weight is going to as you cut that, the weight is going to as you cut that, the weight is going to drop. I imagine the weight ends up lower drop. I imagine the weight ends up lower drop. I imagine the weight ends up lower than it started. Here's a closer look at than it started. Here's a closer look at than it started. Here's a closer look at the setup. You have a spring hanging the setup. You have a spring hanging the setup. You have a spring hanging from a hookup here. And then via this from a hookup here. And then via this from a hookup here. And then via this green rope, it's connected to another green rope, it's connected to another green rope, it's connected to another spring that's carrying this weight below spring that's carrying this weight below spring that's carrying this weight below them. There are two extra ropes here as them. There are two extra ropes here as them. There are two extra ropes here as well. So the red one and the black one well. So the red one and the black one well. So the red one and the black one are slack. They're not under any tension are slack. They're not under any tension are slack. They're not under any tension whatsoever. So they're not actually whatsoever. So they're not actually whatsoever. So they're not actually carrying any weight. What's going to carrying any weight. What's going to carrying any weight. What's going to happen if you cut the green rope? You happen if you cut the green rope? You happen if you cut the green rope? You can pause the video here and try to can pause the video here and try to can pause the video here and try to figure it out for yourself. Wait, what? Here it is in slow motion. Wait, what? Here it is in slow motion. Wait, what? Here it is in slow motion. So, even though the ropes on the side So, even though the ropes on the side So, even though the ropes on the side were slack and we cut the only rope in were slack and we cut the only rope in were slack and we cut the only rope in tension, the weight somehow went up. tension, the weight somehow went up. tension, the weight somehow went up. Okay, so if you're unconvinced that Okay, so if you're unconvinced that Okay, so if you're unconvinced that cutting the green rope actually makes cutting the green rope actually makes cutting the green rope actually makes the weight go up, here's a huge version the weight go up, here's a huge version the weight go up, here's a huge version of the experiment. So, the black and red of the experiment. So, the black and red of the experiment. So, the black and red ropes are still very much slack and it's ropes are still very much slack and it's ropes are still very much slack and it's just held together by this tiny piece of just held together by this tiny piece of just held together by this tiny piece of green rope here. So, let's see what green rope here. So, let's see what green rope here. So, let's see what happens now. Okay, you ready? happens now. Okay, you ready? happens now. Okay, you ready? [Music] [Music] [Music] Okay. Three, two, one. Okay. Three, two, one. Okay. Three, two, one. [Music] [Music] [Music] That was actually insane. That was That was actually insane. That was That was actually insane. That was pretty pretty good, right? I still don't pretty pretty good, right? I still don't pretty pretty good, right? I still don't believe it looking at it. Okay, so why believe it looking at it. Okay, so why believe it looking at it. Okay, so why does this actually happen? Cuz the does this actually happen? Cuz the does this actually happen? Cuz the springs are contracting back and just springs are contracting back and just springs are contracting back and just pulling it together. Maybe the tension pulling it together. Maybe the tension pulling it together. Maybe the tension in the, you know, this part is changed. in the, you know, this part is changed. in the, you know, this part is changed. It releases the tension in the springs It releases the tension in the springs It releases the tension in the springs and only goes to the length of the and only goes to the length of the and only goes to the length of the ropes. Look at what happens when you remove the Look at what happens when you remove the Look at what happens when you remove the slack side ropes from the initial setup. slack side ropes from the initial setup. slack side ropes from the initial setup. You're left with this a mass hanging You're left with this a mass hanging You're left with this a mass hanging from a spring hanging from another from a spring hanging from another from a spring hanging from another spring. So these springs are connected spring. So these springs are connected spring. So these springs are connected in series. Obviously when you hang a in series. Obviously when you hang a in series. Obviously when you hang a weight from one spring, it extends just weight from one spring, it extends just weight from one spring, it extends just like you'd expect. And the amount it like you'd expect. And the amount it like you'd expect. And the amount it extends by, call it X, is proportional extends by, call it X, is proportional extends by, call it X, is proportional to the force exerted by the weight. to the force exerted by the weight. to the force exerted by the weight. That's Hook's law. But if you add That's Hook's law. But if you add That's Hook's law. But if you add another spring in between in series, now another spring in between in series, now another spring in between in series, now both springs extend roughly the same both springs extend roughly the same both springs extend roughly the same amount, X, because both springs feel the amount, X, because both springs feel the amount, X, because both springs feel the same force of the weight pulling from same force of the weight pulling from same force of the weight pulling from below. So in the case of ideal massless below. So in the case of ideal massless below. So in the case of ideal massless springs, you would end up with exactly springs, you would end up with exactly springs, you would end up with exactly 2x of displacement. Now there's another 2x of displacement. Now there's another 2x of displacement. Now there's another way to connect these two springs to the way to connect these two springs to the way to connect these two springs to the weight, and that is in parallel. This weight, and that is in parallel. This weight, and that is in parallel. This way, both springs are independently way, both springs are independently way, both springs are independently connected to the hook above and to the connected to the hook above and to the connected to the hook above and to the weight. So, each spring is only carrying weight. So, each spring is only carrying weight. So, each spring is only carrying half the weight of the mass below, which half the weight of the mass below, which half the weight of the mass below, which is why both springs extend only half as is why both springs extend only half as is why both springs extend only half as far or x over two. If you look at the far or x over two. If you look at the far or x over two. If you look at the setup right after the green rope is cut, setup right after the green rope is cut, setup right after the green rope is cut, you'll notice that this is actually you'll notice that this is actually you'll notice that this is actually exactly how the springs are laid out. exactly how the springs are laid out. exactly how the springs are laid out. So, the red rope is connecting the So, the red rope is connecting the So, the red rope is connecting the bottom spring directly to the hook bottom spring directly to the hook bottom spring directly to the hook above, and the black rope is connecting above, and the black rope is connecting above, and the black rope is connecting the top spring to the weight. So these the top spring to the weight. So these the top spring to the weight. So these springs are in parallel. springs are in parallel. springs are in parallel. So by cutting the green rope, you're So by cutting the green rope, you're So by cutting the green rope, you're actually forcing the springs to go from actually forcing the springs to go from actually forcing the springs to go from a series to a parallel. And that change a series to a parallel. And that change a series to a parallel. And that change is what causes the contraction to is what causes the contraction to is what causes the contraction to happen. When you cut the rope, each happen. When you cut the rope, each happen. When you cut the rope, each spring only extends by about half as far spring only extends by about half as far spring only extends by about half as far as before, which is why you can add so as before, which is why you can add so as before, which is why you can add so much slack on these black and red ropes much slack on these black and red ropes much slack on these black and red ropes to give the impression that the weight to give the impression that the weight to give the impression that the weight is going to fall down. When you cut the is going to fall down. When you cut the is going to fall down. When you cut the rope, you go from series to parallel and rope, you go from series to parallel and rope, you go from series to parallel and that pushes you up. The slack ropes, that pushes you up. The slack ropes, that pushes you up. The slack ropes, that's where I get to cheat. And that that's where I get to cheat. And that that's where I get to cheat. And that that's that's the misleading bit, you that's that's the misleading bit, you that's that's the misleading bit, you know. Yeah, know. Yeah, know. Yeah, the key to getting this paradox right the key to getting this paradox right the key to getting this paradox right comes down to the length of the slack comes down to the length of the slack comes down to the length of the slack ropes. Each one has to be longer than ropes. Each one has to be longer than ropes. Each one has to be longer than the length of one of the springs in the length of one of the springs in the length of one of the springs in series plus the green rope. That's what series plus the green rope. That's what series plus the green rope. That's what adds the slack. But they also can't be adds the slack. But they also can't be adds the slack. But they also can't be much longer than that because too much much longer than that because too much much longer than that because too much slack will nullify the contraction you slack will nullify the contraction you slack will nullify the contraction you get between series and parallel and the get between series and parallel and the get between series and parallel and the weight will still fall. weight will still fall. weight will still fall. Now, you might think that this paradox Now, you might think that this paradox Now, you might think that this paradox only really works with the springs in only really works with the springs in only really works with the springs in this demo, but the first time it was this demo, but the first time it was this demo, but the first time it was discovered was actually because of its discovered was actually because of its discovered was actually because of its influence on people. influence on people. influence on people. In April of 1990, New York was getting In April of 1990, New York was getting In April of 1990, New York was getting ready for its 20th annual Earth Day. It ready for its 20th annual Earth Day. It ready for its 20th annual Earth Day. It was going to be Manhattan's biggest was going to be Manhattan's biggest was going to be Manhattan's biggest celebration of environmentalism to date. celebration of environmentalism to date. celebration of environmentalism to date. Stop the war against the Earth. On the Stop the war against the Earth. On the Stop the war against the Earth. On the day, Central Park was turned into a day, Central Park was turned into a day, Central Park was turned into a massive festival ground with almost a massive festival ground with almost a massive festival ground with almost a million people pouring in to see a million people pouring in to see a million people pouring in to see a stacked lineup of performers, including stacked lineup of performers, including stacked lineup of performers, including Hallen Oats and the B-52s. But the boldest stunt of the day was to But the boldest stunt of the day was to But the boldest stunt of the day was to ban traffic on some of New York's most ban traffic on some of New York's most ban traffic on some of New York's most important streets, including 42nd important streets, including 42nd important streets, including 42nd Street, one of the busiest streets in Street, one of the busiest streets in Street, one of the busiest streets in Manhattan. It stretches from river to Manhattan. It stretches from river to Manhattan. It stretches from river to river connecting Time Square to Grand river connecting Time Square to Grand river connecting Time Square to Grand Central Station and it's almost always Central Station and it's almost always Central Station and it's almost always jammed with slowmoving traffic. The only jammed with slowmoving traffic. The only jammed with slowmoving traffic. The only thing that's an hour from 42nd Street is thing that's an hour from 42nd Street is thing that's an hour from 42nd Street is 43rd Street. And maybe not surprisingly, 43rd Street. And maybe not surprisingly, 43rd Street. And maybe not surprisingly, people were really against this idea, people were really against this idea, people were really against this idea, insisting that just a 6-hour closure of insisting that just a 6-hour closure of insisting that just a 6-hour closure of 42nd Street would mean doomsday. As the 42nd Street would mean doomsday. As the 42nd Street would mean doomsday. As the commissioner of New York's Department of commissioner of New York's Department of commissioner of New York's Department of Transportation put it, you didn't need Transportation put it, you didn't need Transportation put it, you didn't need to be a rocket scientist or have a to be a rocket scientist or have a to be a rocket scientist or have a sophisticated computer queuing model to sophisticated computer queuing model to sophisticated computer queuing model to see that this could have been a major see that this could have been a major see that this could have been a major problem. But the city went ahead with it problem. But the city went ahead with it problem. But the city went ahead with it anyway, and no cars were allowed on 42nd anyway, and no cars were allowed on 42nd anyway, and no cars were allowed on 42nd Street for the day. Street for the day. Street for the day. Now, to everyone's surprise, the traffic Now, to everyone's surprise, the traffic Now, to everyone's surprise, the traffic in the surrounding area actually got in the surrounding area actually got in the surrounding area actually got better. The number of cars was reduced better. The number of cars was reduced better. The number of cars was reduced by 20% with bystanders claiming the by 20% with bystanders claiming the by 20% with bystanders claiming the whole area was a ghost town compared to whole area was a ghost town compared to whole area was a ghost town compared to the way it normally is. But one man the way it normally is. But one man the way it normally is. But one man wasn't surprised by this result. In wasn't surprised by this result. In wasn't surprised by this result. In fact, he predicted it over 20 years fact, he predicted it over 20 years fact, he predicted it over 20 years earlier. earlier. earlier. His name was Dietrich Braze, a German His name was Dietrich Braze, a German His name was Dietrich Braze, a German mathematician. And back in 1968, Braze mathematician. And back in 1968, Braze mathematician. And back in 1968, Braze was studying road networks. As part of was studying road networks. As part of was studying road networks. As part of his research, he imagined a scenario his research, he imagined a scenario his research, he imagined a scenario where drivers from one side of a where drivers from one side of a where drivers from one side of a fictional town were trying to get to the fictional town were trying to get to the fictional town were trying to get to the other. But there were only two possible other. But there were only two possible other. But there were only two possible routes the drivers could take. Route one routes the drivers could take. Route one routes the drivers could take. Route one starts with a wide highway that takes starts with a wide highway that takes starts with a wide highway that takes you halfway across town. The road is so you halfway across town. The road is so you halfway across town. The road is so wide that regardless of how many cars wide that regardless of how many cars wide that regardless of how many cars are on it, this part of the trip always are on it, this part of the trip always are on it, this part of the trip always takes 25 minutes. The second half of takes 25 minutes. The second half of takes 25 minutes. The second half of this route turns into a narrow city this route turns into a narrow city this route turns into a narrow city street, and the time to drive through street, and the time to drive through street, and the time to drive through this street depends on how many cars are this street depends on how many cars are this street depends on how many cars are on it. For every 100 cars on the street, on it. For every 100 cars on the street, on it. For every 100 cars on the street, the time to pass through it takes an the time to pass through it takes an the time to pass through it takes an additional minute. So 100 cars will take additional minute. So 100 cars will take additional minute. So 100 cars will take 1 minute, 200 cars will take 2 minutes, 1 minute, 200 cars will take 2 minutes, 1 minute, 200 cars will take 2 minutes, and so on. The second route through town and so on. The second route through town and so on. The second route through town starts with a similar narrow city street starts with a similar narrow city street starts with a similar narrow city street that depends on the number of cars. It that depends on the number of cars. It that depends on the number of cars. It takes you halfway across and then turns takes you halfway across and then turns takes you halfway across and then turns into another 25-minute highway stretch into another 25-minute highway stretch into another 25-minute highway stretch where the transit time doesn't depend on where the transit time doesn't depend on where the transit time doesn't depend on traffic. So which route would you take traffic. So which route would you take traffic. So which route would you take to get across town? Well, you can see to get across town? Well, you can see to get across town? Well, you can see that the routes are identical but that the routes are identical but that the routes are identical but flipped. So, it doesn't really matter. flipped. So, it doesn't really matter. flipped. So, it doesn't really matter. Since this is just a mathematical model, Since this is just a mathematical model, Since this is just a mathematical model, both will get you there at the same both will get you there at the same both will get you there at the same time. So, say there were 2,000 drivers time. So, say there were 2,000 drivers time. So, say there were 2,000 drivers trying to get across the city. Half of trying to get across the city. Half of trying to get across the city. Half of the cars would end up on the first route the cars would end up on the first route the cars would end up on the first route and half on the second route. And since and half on the second route. And since and half on the second route. And since there are now 1,000 cars going down each there are now 1,000 cars going down each there are now 1,000 cars going down each narrow city street, the travel time on narrow city street, the travel time on narrow city street, the travel time on these segments increases to 10 minutes. these segments increases to 10 minutes. these segments increases to 10 minutes. So, the total time on both routes is 10 So, the total time on both routes is 10 So, the total time on both routes is 10 minutes for the narrow street plus 25 minutes for the narrow street plus 25 minutes for the narrow street plus 25 minutes for the highway. A total of 35 minutes for the highway. A total of 35 minutes for the highway. A total of 35 minutes regardless of route. But now, minutes regardless of route. But now, minutes regardless of route. But now, say the city decides to connect these say the city decides to connect these say the city decides to connect these two routes at the halfway point with a two routes at the halfway point with a two routes at the halfway point with a small piece of highway to give drivers small piece of highway to give drivers small piece of highway to give drivers more options. This piece only takes a more options. This piece only takes a more options. This piece only takes a minute to travel across. So, which roads minute to travel across. So, which roads minute to travel across. So, which roads would you use now to get across town? would you use now to get across town? would you use now to get across town? Well, as an individual driver, you Well, as an individual driver, you Well, as an individual driver, you should just go straight down. It will should just go straight down. It will should just go straight down. It will take you 10 minutes to get through the take you 10 minutes to get through the take you 10 minutes to get through the first city street, 1 minute on the new first city street, 1 minute on the new first city street, 1 minute on the new connecting road, and another 10 minutes connecting road, and another 10 minutes connecting road, and another 10 minutes for the second street. So your total for the second street. So your total for the second street. So your total journey time would now be only 21 journey time would now be only 21 journey time would now be only 21 minutes compared to the 35 minutes for minutes compared to the 35 minutes for minutes compared to the 35 minutes for everyone else on routes 1 and two. Okay, everyone else on routes 1 and two. Okay, everyone else on routes 1 and two. Okay, great. So you minimize your own time and great. So you minimize your own time and great. So you minimize your own time and that's that, right? Well, not really. that's that, right? Well, not really. that's that, right? Well, not really. See, drivers like you are selfish and See, drivers like you are selfish and See, drivers like you are selfish and everyone wants the shortest possible everyone wants the shortest possible everyone wants the shortest possible travel time, which means everyone starts travel time, which means everyone starts travel time, which means everyone starts flooding the narrow city streets. As flooding the narrow city streets. As flooding the narrow city streets. As drivers switch to this new shortcut, the drivers switch to this new shortcut, the drivers switch to this new shortcut, the narrow streets become more and more narrow streets become more and more narrow streets become more and more congested, making the route slower and congested, making the route slower and congested, making the route slower and slower. But this makes the original slower. But this makes the original slower. But this makes the original routes worse, too. Because the time to routes worse, too. Because the time to routes worse, too. Because the time to get through the street segments keeps get through the street segments keeps get through the street segments keeps increasing for every driver. So, increasing for every driver. So, increasing for every driver. So, everyone decides to switch to the everyone decides to switch to the everyone decides to switch to the shortcut. And now all 2,000 cars are shortcut. And now all 2,000 cars are shortcut. And now all 2,000 cars are driving down the city streets. Now, the driving down the city streets. Now, the driving down the city streets. Now, the time to traverse each city street jumps time to traverse each city street jumps time to traverse each city street jumps to 20 minutes. So, the total journey to 20 minutes. So, the total journey to 20 minutes. So, the total journey time for everyone increases to a time for everyone increases to a time for everyone increases to a whopping 41 minutes compared to the 35 whopping 41 minutes compared to the 35 whopping 41 minutes compared to the 35 minutes we had before the new road was minutes we had before the new road was minutes we had before the new road was constructed. So traffic actually got constructed. So traffic actually got constructed. So traffic actually got worse for everyone. worse for everyone. worse for everyone. To fix it, the drivers could simply go To fix it, the drivers could simply go To fix it, the drivers could simply go back to their original routes, right? back to their original routes, right? back to their original routes, right? Well, who's going to be the first to Well, who's going to be the first to Well, who's going to be the first to switch back? If any one driver goes back switch back? If any one driver goes back switch back? If any one driver goes back to Route 1 or two, their journey time to Route 1 or two, their journey time to Route 1 or two, their journey time will be the 25 minutes on the highway will be the 25 minutes on the highway will be the 25 minutes on the highway plus 20 minutes on the now congested plus 20 minutes on the now congested plus 20 minutes on the now congested city streets, or 45 minutes in total, city streets, or 45 minutes in total, city streets, or 45 minutes in total, which is even worse than the now which is even worse than the now which is even worse than the now congested streets. So, no single driver congested streets. So, no single driver congested streets. So, no single driver would ever want to go back to the would ever want to go back to the would ever want to go back to the original route. And because humans are original route. And because humans are original route. And because humans are humans, it's not like we could all just humans, it's not like we could all just humans, it's not like we could all just agree to ignore this new road. So, even agree to ignore this new road. So, even agree to ignore this new road. So, even though every driver was making a though every driver was making a though every driver was making a rational decision to try to minimize rational decision to try to minimize rational decision to try to minimize their own travel time by just using the their own travel time by just using the their own travel time by just using the city streets, collectively, this made city streets, collectively, this made city streets, collectively, this made the situation worse for everyone, and the situation worse for everyone, and the situation worse for everyone, and there's no way out. But if the city were there's no way out. But if the city were there's no way out. But if the city were to destroy this new connecting road, to destroy this new connecting road, to destroy this new connecting road, everyone's journey time would drop from everyone's journey time would drop from everyone's journey time would drop from 41 minutes back to the original 35 41 minutes back to the original 35 41 minutes back to the original 35 minutes on route 1 and two. So removing minutes on route 1 and two. So removing minutes on route 1 and two. So removing the road would actually make the traffic the road would actually make the traffic the road would actually make the traffic better. It's just like cutting the green better. It's just like cutting the green better. It's just like cutting the green rope from before. That's because both of rope from before. That's because both of rope from before. That's because both of these are examples of the same paradox. these are examples of the same paradox. these are examples of the same paradox. The springs are like the narrow city The springs are like the narrow city The springs are like the narrow city roads. The more weight or cars you add, roads. The more weight or cars you add, roads. The more weight or cars you add, the longer they get. And the ropes are the longer they get. And the ropes are the longer they get. And the ropes are like the highways. It doesn't matter how like the highways. It doesn't matter how like the highways. It doesn't matter how much weight is on them, they don't much weight is on them, they don't much weight is on them, they don't change. That is unless you don't know change. That is unless you don't know change. That is unless you don't know how to tie them properly. how to tie them properly. how to tie them properly. My god. This is the paradox Dietrich My god. This is the paradox Dietrich My god. This is the paradox Dietrich Braze discovered in 1968. It's now known Braze discovered in 1968. It's now known Braze discovered in 1968. It's now known as Brazy's paradox, and it is the reason as Brazy's paradox, and it is the reason as Brazy's paradox, and it is the reason why New York traffic got better after why New York traffic got better after why New York traffic got better after 42nd Street was closed on Earth Day. 42nd Street was closed on Earth Day. 42nd Street was closed on Earth Day. Now, sure, you'd be right to argue that Now, sure, you'd be right to argue that Now, sure, you'd be right to argue that the reason the traffic decreased on the reason the traffic decreased on the reason the traffic decreased on Earth Day in New York was simply because Earth Day in New York was simply because Earth Day in New York was simply because people decided to walk or cycle more people decided to walk or cycle more people decided to walk or cycle more that day, but it turns out that day, but it turns out that day, but it turns out mathematicians actually modeled the mathematicians actually modeled the mathematicians actually modeled the whole city in 2008. And they found 12 whole city in 2008. And they found 12 whole city in 2008. And they found 12 roads that were redundant and could be roads that were redundant and could be roads that were redundant and could be cut to actually reduce traffic. And it's cut to actually reduce traffic. And it's cut to actually reduce traffic. And it's not only New York. The paradox showed up not only New York. The paradox showed up not only New York. The paradox showed up in Boston, London, Seoul. In fact, if in Boston, London, Seoul. In fact, if in Boston, London, Seoul. In fact, if you were to randomly add a new road to you were to randomly add a new road to you were to randomly add a new road to just about any city, you'd have an equal just about any city, you'd have an equal just about any city, you'd have an equal chance of making the traffic better as chance of making the traffic better as chance of making the traffic better as worse. worse. worse. But there's nothing special about the But there's nothing special about the But there's nothing special about the flow of cars. Say instead you want to flow of cars. Say instead you want to flow of cars. Say instead you want to send electricity from one station to send electricity from one station to send electricity from one station to another. Well, now you're looking at the another. Well, now you're looking at the another. Well, now you're looking at the flow of electrons in a power grid. And flow of electrons in a power grid. And flow of electrons in a power grid. And just as before, you could try to improve just as before, you could try to improve just as before, you could try to improve the grid by increasing the capacity of the grid by increasing the capacity of the grid by increasing the capacity of existing lines or by adding new lines. existing lines or by adding new lines. existing lines or by adding new lines. But it turns out that this can actually But it turns out that this can actually But it turns out that this can actually destabilize the grid or even cause a destabilize the grid or even cause a destabilize the grid or even cause a blackout. And virtually any other blackout. And virtually any other blackout. And virtually any other network, anytime you're sending things network, anytime you're sending things network, anytime you're sending things from one place to another, it can fall from one place to another, it can fall from one place to another, it can fall prey to Brazy's paradox. Be it a food prey to Brazy's paradox. Be it a food prey to Brazy's paradox. Be it a food chain, blockchain, or even the internet. chain, blockchain, or even the internet. chain, blockchain, or even the internet. Adding elements to the network can make Adding elements to the network can make Adding elements to the network can make it worse. it worse. it worse. So less can actually be more.

You every time you modify a network. You every time you modify a network. You need a very specific set of conditions need a very specific set of conditions need a very specific set of conditions for it to occur. But if you can make it for it to occur.

So, we're here at the Amolf Institute where we're here at the Amolf Institute where we're here at the Amolf Institute where they actually figured out how to make they actually figured out how to make they actually figured out how to make something shrink when you pull it. So, something shrink when you pull it. So, something shrink when you pull it. So, let's go check it out. Is it here? Yeah, let's go check it out. Is it here? Yeah, let's go check it out. Is it here? Yeah, I made all these samples. That's so weird. That's so weird. That's so weird. Yeah, right. I guess you never expect Yeah, right. I guess you never expect Yeah, right. I guess you never expect things to yank back on you so things to yank back on you so things to yank back on you so unexpectedly cuz a rubber band, you're unexpectedly cuz a rubber band, you're unexpectedly cuz a rubber band, you're stretching it and you feel it wants to stretching it and you feel it wants to stretching it and you feel it wants to pull back on you more and more, but here pull back on you more and more, but here pull back on you more and more, but here it just you're never ready for freezing it just you're never ready for freezing it just you're never ready for freezing suddenly, which it's a weird feeling. suddenly, which it's a weird feeling. suddenly, which it's a weird feeling. There's something almost like human There's something almost like human There's something almost like human about it where it starts tugging back on about it where it starts tugging back on about it where it starts tugging back on you when it gets bad. What's special you when it gets bad. What's special you when it gets bad. What's special about this mechanism is that everything about this mechanism is that everything about this mechanism is that everything else around us works in the complete else around us works in the complete else around us works in the complete opposite way. Try to press one of your opposite way. Try to press one of your opposite way. Try to press one of your keyboard buttons slowly so that it keyboard buttons slowly so that it keyboard buttons slowly so that it steadily goes down into place. You can't steadily goes down into place. You can't steadily goes down into place. You can't do it. No matter how slowly you go, do it. No matter how slowly you go, do it. No matter how slowly you go, there is some point at which it just there is some point at which it just there is some point at which it just gives way and clicks through. The same gives way and clicks through. The same gives way and clicks through. The same happens if you try to stretch a bendy happens if you try to stretch a bendy happens if you try to stretch a bendy straw. You can pull on it as slowly as straw. You can pull on it as slowly as straw. You can pull on it as slowly as you like, but at some point the you like, but at some point the you like, but at some point the individual straw joints are going to individual straw joints are going to individual straw joints are going to expand suddenly. light switches, expand suddenly. light switches, expand suddenly. light switches, eyeglasses, grasshopper legs, these all eyeglasses, grasshopper legs, these all eyeglasses, grasshopper legs, these all have a failure point beyond which they have a failure point beyond which they have a failure point beyond which they give way and quickly snap into a give way and quickly snap into a give way and quickly snap into a different position. And this is called different position. And this is called different position. And this is called well snapping. Here it is mapped to a well snapping. Here it is mapped to a well snapping. Here it is mapped to a force displacement graph. As you'd force displacement graph. As you'd force displacement graph. As you'd expect, the more force you apply, the expect, the more force you apply, the expect, the more force you apply, the more the material bends or displaces. more the material bends or displaces. more the material bends or displaces. But eventually you reach a tipping point But eventually you reach a tipping point But eventually you reach a tipping point and beyond it, the force required to and beyond it, the force required to and beyond it, the force required to bend the material further actually bend the material further actually bend the material further actually drops. So if you apply a force higher drops. So if you apply a force higher drops. So if you apply a force higher than that peak, the displacement has to than that peak, the displacement has to than that peak, the displacement has to rush to the next corresponding value to rush to the next corresponding value to rush to the next corresponding value to match the force which is all the way on match the force which is all the way on match the force which is all the way on the other side of this dip. And as a the other side of this dip. And as a the other side of this dip. And as a result, you get a huge amount of result, you get a huge amount of result, you get a huge amount of displacement for that tiny increase in displacement for that tiny increase in displacement for that tiny increase in force. That's what creates the sudden force. That's what creates the sudden force. That's what creates the sudden snap. It's very intuitive. I mean, snap. It's very intuitive. I mean, snap. It's very intuitive. I mean, you've all experienced it, at least if you've all experienced it, at least if you've all experienced it, at least if you're in the Netherlands, with your you're in the Netherlands, with your you're in the Netherlands, with your umbrella. There's a gust of wind umbrella. There's a gust of wind umbrella. There's a gust of wind underneath your umbrella. It pops to the underneath your umbrella. It pops to the underneath your umbrella. It pops to the other side. So you sort of go over a other side. So you sort of go over a other side. So you sort of go over a peak in energy or in force and it peak in energy or in force and it peak in energy or in force and it suddenly snaps and typically it becomes suddenly snaps and typically it becomes suddenly snaps and typically it becomes softer. And this is the way all things softer. And this is the way all things softer. And this is the way all things snap. Everything used to fail in the snap. Everything used to fail in the snap. Everything used to fail in the direction of the applied force until direction of the applied force until direction of the applied force until this mechanism came about doing the this mechanism came about doing the this mechanism came about doing the exact opposite of snapping. Call it exact opposite of snapping. Call it exact opposite of snapping. Call it counter snapping. Imagine that gust of counter snapping. Imagine that gust of counter snapping. Imagine that gust of wind blows under your umbrella but wind blows under your umbrella but wind blows under your umbrella but instead of flipping out your umbrella instead of flipping out your umbrella instead of flipping out your umbrella suddenly closes in. Or you try to pull suddenly closes in. Or you try to pull suddenly closes in. Or you try to pull apart a straw and the joints suddenly apart a straw and the joints suddenly apart a straw and the joints suddenly contract. The wind is pushing on my contract. The wind is pushing on my contract. The wind is pushing on my umbrella, but instead of it folding out, umbrella, but instead of it folding out, umbrella, but instead of it folding out, it would push itself against the wind to it would push itself against the wind to it would push itself against the wind to close itself, right? But it feels like close itself, right? But it feels like close itself, right? But it feels like it violates physics. It It's just so so it violates physics. It It's just so so it violates physics. It It's just so so counterintuitive that the displacement counterintuitive that the displacement counterintuitive that the displacement is in in the other direction to the is in in the other direction to the is in in the other direction to the force. That's why it's fun. So, how does force. That's why it's fun. So, how does force. That's why it's fun. So, how does this thing work? Well, the mechanism this thing work? Well, the mechanism this thing work? Well, the mechanism itself is built out of three different itself is built out of three different itself is built out of three different components, and on their own, they all components, and on their own, they all components, and on their own, they all stretch normally when you try to pull stretch normally when you try to pull stretch normally when you try to pull them apart. Individually, they behave them apart. Individually, they behave them apart. Individually, they behave like springs in the sense that they like springs in the sense that they like springs in the sense that they extend when you pull on them, but then extend when you pull on them, but then extend when you pull on them, but then you combine them together, and then you combine them together, and then you combine them together, and then suddenly they shrink. Exactly. If you suddenly they shrink. Exactly. If you suddenly they shrink. Exactly. If you draw the system as a set of springs, it draw the system as a set of springs, it draw the system as a set of springs, it looks something like this. The long and looks something like this. The long and looks something like this. The long and lanky components represent the two lanky components represent the two lanky components represent the two springs on the sides, but they actually springs on the sides, but they actually springs on the sides, but they actually don't feel like springs at all. You can don't feel like springs at all. You can don't feel like springs at all. You can easily pull them apart until they easily pull them apart until they easily pull them apart until they suddenly get very stiff. Meanwhile, suddenly get very stiff. Meanwhile, suddenly get very stiff. Meanwhile, these pieces represent the top and these pieces represent the top and these pieces represent the top and bottom springs, and they feel a lot more bottom springs, and they feel a lot more bottom springs, and they feel a lot more springy. So, the more you pull them, the springy. So, the more you pull them, the springy. So, the more you pull them, the more they pull back. And finally, the more they pull back. And finally, the more they pull back. And finally, the central piece. It looks very similar to central piece. It looks very similar to central piece. It looks very similar to the previous one, but pulling it apart the previous one, but pulling it apart the previous one, but pulling it apart feels very snappy. In fact, you can even feels very snappy. In fact, you can even feels very snappy. In fact, you can even hear it snap out. hear it snap out. hear it snap out. Put them all together and you get the Put them all together and you get the Put them all together and you get the mechanism. If you stretch it slowly, mechanism. If you stretch it slowly, mechanism. If you stretch it slowly, you'll see how tension builds up in the you'll see how tension builds up in the you'll see how tension builds up in the three middle pieces with the sides three middle pieces with the sides three middle pieces with the sides staying mostly relaxed. But if you keep staying mostly relaxed. But if you keep staying mostly relaxed. But if you keep stretching, the centerpiece will stretching, the centerpiece will stretching, the centerpiece will suddenly snap out and transfer most of suddenly snap out and transfer most of suddenly snap out and transfer most of its tension to the side springs. This its tension to the side springs. This its tension to the side springs. This causes the system to stiffen and shrink. causes the system to stiffen and shrink. causes the system to stiffen and shrink. If you now let go, the system resets, so If you now let go, the system resets, so If you now let go, the system resets, so the mechanism can flip between a set of the mechanism can flip between a set of the mechanism can flip between a set of springs in series to one in parallel. springs in series to one in parallel. springs in series to one in parallel. It's a reversible case of Brazy's It's a reversible case of Brazy's It's a reversible case of Brazy's paradox. The network is basically the paradox. The network is basically the paradox. The network is basically the same as the brush paradox. So the the same as the brush paradox. So the the same as the brush paradox. So the the way they connected, the topology of the way they connected, the topology of the way they connected, the topology of the connection is exactly the same. The connection is exactly the same. The connection is exactly the same. The force displacement graph you get for the force displacement graph you get for the force displacement graph you get for the mechanism is one that loops in on itself mechanism is one that loops in on itself mechanism is one that loops in on itself with two distinct curves. One for the with two distinct curves. One for the with two distinct curves. One for the system in series and the other for the system in series and the other for the system in series and the other for the system in parallel. And this leads to system in parallel. And this leads to system in parallel. And this leads to some pretty remarkable properties. If some pretty remarkable properties. If some pretty remarkable properties. If you slowly control the stretching force you slowly control the stretching force you slowly control the stretching force by adding water to a cup below the by adding water to a cup below the by adding water to a cup below the mechanism, the mechanism first slightly mechanism, the mechanism first slightly mechanism, the mechanism first slightly sags like you'd expect. But when you sags like you'd expect. But when you sags like you'd expect. But when you reach the tipping point at the end of reach the tipping point at the end of reach the tipping point at the end of this curve, the displacement has to this curve, the displacement has to this curve, the displacement has to quickly reduce to keep following the quickly reduce to keep following the quickly reduce to keep following the force along the graph. And this jump force along the graph. And this jump force along the graph. And this jump back is why the mechanism shrinks. Now back is why the mechanism shrinks. Now back is why the mechanism shrinks. Now you can also control displacement you can also control displacement you can also control displacement instead of force and measure how much instead of force and measure how much instead of force and measure how much force it takes to stretch the mechanism force it takes to stretch the mechanism force it takes to stretch the mechanism at any point. This time when you reach at any point. This time when you reach at any point. This time when you reach the tipping point, it's the force that the tipping point, it's the force that the tipping point, it's the force that has to follow displacement along the has to follow displacement along the has to follow displacement along the graph. So you get a sudden jump up in graph. So you get a sudden jump up in graph. So you get a sudden jump up in force showing that the material has force showing that the material has force showing that the material has stiffened. Oh, this little force jump is stiffened. Oh, this little force jump is stiffened. Oh, this little force jump is enough to make it slip out of your enough to make it slip out of your enough to make it slip out of your hands. If example, I mean it even though hands. If example, I mean it even though hands. If example, I mean it even though you said it is a small jump, it's like you said it is a small jump, it's like you said it is a small jump, it's like this is the only thing that does this this is the only thing that does this this is the only thing that does this anywhere probably on Earth. Uh yeah, as anywhere probably on Earth. Uh yeah, as anywhere probably on Earth. Uh yeah, as far as we know, the force jumping like far as we know, the force jumping like far as we know, the force jumping like this, it was not reported. It is pretty this, it was not reported. It is pretty this, it was not reported. It is pretty insane. So what is counter snapping insane. So what is counter snapping insane. So what is counter snapping actually useful for? Well, notice that actually useful for? Well, notice that actually useful for? Well, notice that there is a force at which the series and there is a force at which the series and there is a force at which the series and parallel curves of the system overlap. parallel curves of the system overlap. parallel curves of the system overlap. Which means that at this force, the Which means that at this force, the Which means that at this force, the mechanism will actually be the same mechanism will actually be the same mechanism will actually be the same length in both states. So if you exert length in both states. So if you exert length in both states. So if you exert that exact force on the structure by for that exact force on the structure by for that exact force on the structure by for example hanging a weight from it, you example hanging a weight from it, you example hanging a weight from it, you can flip between the two states by can flip between the two states by can flip between the two states by giving the mechanism a little tug. And giving the mechanism a little tug. And giving the mechanism a little tug. And although that will change whether the although that will change whether the although that will change whether the springs are in series or parallel, it springs are in series or parallel, it springs are in series or parallel, it won't change how long the system won't change how long the system won't change how long the system actually is. So you can change the actually is. So you can change the actually is. So you can change the stiffness without changing the length. stiffness without changing the length. stiffness without changing the length. Now look at what happens if you give the Now look at what happens if you give the Now look at what happens if you give the mechanism a nudge in its original series mechanism a nudge in its original series mechanism a nudge in its original series state. If you poke it, you it's state. If you poke it, you it's state. If you poke it, you it's basically a way to measure the natural basically a way to measure the natural basically a way to measure the natural frequency. Oh yeah. When the mechanism frequency. Oh yeah. When the mechanism frequency. Oh yeah. When the mechanism is in series, the natural frequency is is in series, the natural frequency is is in series, the natural frequency is 3.7 hertz. But if you switch to a 3.7 hertz. But if you switch to a 3.7 hertz. But if you switch to a parallel setup, the natural frequency parallel setup, the natural frequency parallel setup, the natural frequency increases to 6.4. 4 hertz. We switch it increases to 6.4. 4 hertz. We switch it increases to 6.4. 4 hertz. We switch it and we look at the natural frequency. and we look at the natural frequency. and we look at the natural frequency. Now we can see it's much higher. Now we can see it's much higher. Now we can see it's much higher. What's unique here is that you're able What's unique here is that you're able What's unique here is that you're able to almost double the natural frequency to almost double the natural frequency to almost double the natural frequency of the material without changing its of the material without changing its of the material without changing its length. I'm going to move the robot length. I'm going to move the robot length. I'm going to move the robot robotic arm very slightly just up and robotic arm very slightly just up and robotic arm very slightly just up and down. Yeah. Okay. And I put a frequency down. Yeah. Okay. And I put a frequency down. Yeah. Okay. And I put a frequency of 3.5 hertz. So it's close to the of 3.5 hertz. So it's close to the of 3.5 hertz. So it's close to the natural frequency of this system. This natural frequency of this system. This natural frequency of this system. This is going to drive the structure into is going to drive the structure into is going to drive the structure into resonance. But once the vibrations get resonance. But once the vibrations get resonance. But once the vibrations get big enough, the mechanism is actually big enough, the mechanism is actually big enough, the mechanism is actually going to switch states on its own, going to switch states on its own, going to switch states on its own, change its natural frequency, and change its natural frequency, and change its natural frequency, and thereby reduce the vibrations. Like it thereby reduce the vibrations. Like it thereby reduce the vibrations. Like it gets stronger and stronger, and then it gets stronger and stronger, and then it gets stronger and stronger, and then it just locks it out. Yeah. Yeah. That's just locks it out. Yeah. Yeah. That's just locks it out. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. The same happens in reverse. If cool. The same happens in reverse. If cool. The same happens in reverse. If you vibrate the robot hand at 6.4 hertz, you vibrate the robot hand at 6.4 hertz, you vibrate the robot hand at 6.4 hertz, the mechanism is quickly going to switch the mechanism is quickly going to switch the mechanism is quickly going to switch back to its original state and minimize back to its original state and minimize back to its original state and minimize the vibrations. the vibrations. the vibrations. It's interesting uh the way that you say It's interesting uh the way that you say It's interesting uh the way that you say it. We're moving the point at which it. We're moving the point at which it. We're moving the point at which resonance happens. And that's what stops resonance happens. And that's what stops resonance happens. And that's what stops excessive vibrations. Yeah. Interesting. excessive vibrations. Yeah. Interesting. excessive vibrations. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Other snapping structures could Yeah. Other snapping structures could Yeah. Other snapping structures could also switch upon resonance. But the also switch upon resonance. But the also switch upon resonance. But the problem that once they switch, they're problem that once they switch, they're problem that once they switch, they're much more elongated, much more much more elongated, much more much more elongated, much more contracted. So they don't, let's say, contracted. So they don't, let's say, contracted. So they don't, let's say, they wouldn't provide the same function. they wouldn't provide the same function. they wouldn't provide the same function. You could use this effect to keep You could use this effect to keep You could use this effect to keep structures from vibrating or reaching structures from vibrating or reaching structures from vibrating or reaching resonance. Could it be easier to install resonance. Could it be easier to install resonance. Could it be easier to install a system like this where you're actually a system like this where you're actually a system like this where you're actually moving the resonance instead of like a moving the resonance instead of like a moving the resonance instead of like a whole tune mass damper or or something whole tune mass damper or or something whole tune mass damper or or something like that? Yeah, I think this solution like that? Yeah, I think this solution like that? Yeah, I think this solution is still very complex. It's very is still very complex. It's very is still very complex. It's very complicated design, but I think the complicated design, but I think the complicated design, but I think the principle could be used. I know it's principle could be used. I know it's principle could be used. I know it's still super early, but I'm really still super early, but I'm really still super early, but I'm really excited to see like it pop up somewhere, excited to see like it pop up somewhere, excited to see like it pop up somewhere, you know, in a couple of years or you know, in a couple of years or you know, in a couple of years or decades. It's more about the concept and decades. It's more about the concept and decades. It's more about the concept and showing what it can do. We're going to showing what it can do. We're going to showing what it can do. We're going to try to see if we can maybe make contra try to see if we can maybe make contra try to see if we can maybe make contra snapping also maybe with different type snapping also maybe with different type snapping also maybe with different type of variables. It's going to be like a of variables. It's going to be like a of variables. It's going to be like a balloon that deflates when you inflate balloon that deflates when you inflate balloon that deflates when you inflate it. it. it. You increase the pressure and the volume You increase the pressure and the volume You increase the pressure and the volume would decrease. Wait, really? That's would decrease. Wait, really? That's would decrease. Wait, really? That's crazy. That would be the equivalent, but crazy. That would be the equivalent, but crazy. That would be the equivalent, but we it's not there yet, but we it's not there yet, but we it's not there yet, but we'll see. That's so cool. In principle, we'll see. That's so cool. In principle, we'll see. That's so cool. In principle, it should be possible. Yeah.
