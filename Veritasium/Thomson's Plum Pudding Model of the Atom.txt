WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en So the word atom means uncuttable so the Greeks were thinking of it as a tiny hard sphere Phil: that's right Derek: and even up until the eighteen hundred's that was the idea of an atom, the smallest piece of matter, a tiny hard sphere but then we find out that that's not quite right not quite there were experiments in the eighteen hundreds that discovered the electron, JJ Thomson's experiments really worked out the electron was smaller than an atom, about 1000 times smaller than a hydrogen atom and it was in all atoms that's right, not just hydrogen whatever material he did his experiments on he found there was electrons in them there are electrons in an all atoms so I guess when you find something smaller than an atom you need to propose a new model for the atom that actually has something smaller in it some substructure Phil: that's right so something like this this is our model of the atom Phil: This is our model of the atom - in his day, it was known as the plum pudding model but uh... here we have cherry tart Phil: cherry tart, ok so but the idea being that we have an overall atom usually pictured as spherical rather than 2D but uh... but imbedded within it and this is the important part there are negative electrons represented by cherries and they can come out the overall atom is neutral, so that means that pudding part must be positive Derek: now how would you get one of these electrons out of our pudding here so electrons are negatively charged so we'll need to put something very positive which attracts electrons, a high voltage Derek: and that would have the effect of say like plucking a cherry out of the pudding that's pretty much it yeah you could do it kind of like that so we're simulating what it would be like to put a positive charge up here. Phil: that's right, that's right Derek: pulling the electrons out of the atom that's quite a delicious Phil: Yeah! well that is the most delicious model of the atom, I've gotta say so shall we uh split the atom? why don't you go ahead Phil: you want me to do it? Derek: yes Who knows what could happen, a whole bunch of energy could be released. Phil: Yeah one, two, three...
