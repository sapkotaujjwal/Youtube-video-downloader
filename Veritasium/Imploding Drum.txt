WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en today I'm at the University of Sydney today I'm at the University of Sydney today I'm at the University of Sydney with Dr Phil and we're talking about the with Dr Phil and we're talking about the with Dr Phil and we're talking about the pressure that all of us are under you pressure that all of us are under you pressure that all of us are under you are under a lot of pressure probably are under a lot of pressure probably are under a lot of pressure probably 10,000 kg 10,000 kg is pressing in on my 10,000 kg 10,000 kg is pressing in on my 10,000 kg 10,000 kg is pressing in on my whole body all from all sides where does whole body all from all sides where does whole body all from all sides where does all this pressure come from it's from all this pressure come from it's from all this pressure come from it's from the air that looks like a dance move on the air that looks like a dance move on the air that looks like a dance move on the I'm lifting 10,000 kg of air you're I'm lifting 10,000 kg of air you're I'm lifting 10,000 kg of air you're lifting the air how much air is there lifting the air how much air is there lifting the air how much air is there above us about 20 km or so so you're at above us about 20 km or so so you're at above us about 20 km or so so you're at the bottom of an ocean of air the bottom of an ocean of air the bottom of an ocean of air so essentially the weight of the air is so essentially the weight of the air is so essentially the weight of the air is squishing me in that's right and and all squishing me in that's right and and all squishing me in that's right and and all of us you too and me too wow you seem to of us you too and me too wow you seem to of us you too and me too wow you seem to be holding up rather well though thank be holding up rather well though thank be holding up rather well though thank you thank you how do you do it what is you thank you how do you do it what is you thank you how do you do it what is well I've got this special trick uhh well I've got this special trick uhh well I've got this special trick uhh uhhuh I've got the same amount of uhhuh I've got the same amount of uhhuh I've got the same amount of pressure inside me okay so since the pressure inside me okay so since the pressure inside me okay so since the pressure is equal inside and outside of pressure is equal inside and outside of pressure is equal inside and outside of you you're in equilibrium and there's no you you're in equilibrium and there's no you you're in equilibrium and there's no sort of crushing or expansion no that's sort of crushing or expansion no that's sort of crushing or expansion no that's right okay right well most people I right okay right well most people I right okay right well most people I think don't recognize the pressure that think don't recognize the pressure that think don't recognize the pressure that they're under at least you the they're under at least you the they're under at least you the atmosphere that's right how can we atmosphere that's right how can we atmosphere that's right how can we demonstrate that the atmosphere is demonstrate that the atmosphere is demonstrate that the atmosphere is exerting this huge pressure on everyone exerting this huge pressure on everyone exerting this huge pressure on everyone the best thing to do is to scoop out the best thing to do is to scoop out the best thing to do is to scoop out their insides and then there'll be no their insides and then there'll be no their insides and then there'll be no pressure on the inside and then they'll pressure on the inside and then they'll pressure on the inside and then they'll be crushed crushed by The Atmosphere by be crushed crushed by The Atmosphere by be crushed crushed by The Atmosphere by the atmosphere and that will be a rather the atmosphere and that will be a rather the atmosphere and that will be a rather clear demonstration exactly of the power clear demonstration exactly of the power clear demonstration exactly of the power of the atmosphere exactly but let's say of the atmosphere exactly but let's say of the atmosphere exactly but let's say we didn't want to kill anyone uh how can we didn't want to kill anyone uh how can we didn't want to kill anyone uh how can we demonstrate this in say a lab well we we demonstrate this in say a lab well we we demonstrate this in say a lab well we could take a model of a person and this could take a model of a person and this could take a model of a person and this drum is meant to be a model of a person drum is meant to be a model of a person drum is meant to be a model of a person that's correct yeah okay and um so what that's correct yeah okay and um so what that's correct yeah okay and um so what are we going to do with it so what we're are we going to do with it so what we're are we going to do with it so what we're going to do is we're going to put some going to do is we're going to put some going to do is we're going to put some water in here why don't we go ahead and water in here why don't we go ahead and water in here why don't we go ahead and do it okay let's do it get it heating it get it heating it get it heating up so we've got some water in the drum up so we've got some water in the drum up so we've got some water in the drum and we're heating it up on this uh and we're heating it up on this uh and we're heating it up on this uh little gas stove here that's right okay little gas stove here that's right okay little gas stove here that's right okay and what is that doing for us so the and what is that doing for us so the and what is that doing for us so the water will heat up and begin to boil so water will heat up and begin to boil so water will heat up and begin to boil so it'll turn from liquid into a vapor that it'll turn from liquid into a vapor that it'll turn from liquid into a vapor that Vapor will push out some of the air okay Vapor will push out some of the air okay Vapor will push out some of the air okay so basically we're going to remove the so basically we're going to remove the so basically we're going to remove the air from inside the drum and replace it air from inside the drum and replace it air from inside the drum and replace it with water vapor that's right okay okay with water vapor that's right okay okay with water vapor that's right okay okay then once we're sure that it's pretty then once we're sure that it's pretty then once we're sure that it's pretty much emptied of air we put the stopper much emptied of air we put the stopper much emptied of air we put the stopper in mhm and cool it back down again okay in mhm and cool it back down again okay in mhm and cool it back down again okay so that's going to condense the water so that's going to condense the water so that's going to condense the water vapor that's right and so what does that vapor that's right and so what does that vapor that's right and so what does that do to the pressure inside the drum it'll do to the pressure inside the drum it'll do to the pressure inside the drum it'll become much smaller okay and then we're become much smaller okay and then we're become much smaller okay and then we're going to be able to see what the going to be able to see what the going to be able to see what the atmosphere does when there's no pressure atmosphere does when there's no pressure atmosphere does when there's no pressure on the inside on the inside on the inside push out ex exactly all right well I push out ex exactly all right well I push out ex exactly all right well I look forward to that all right so how look forward to that all right so how look forward to that all right so how long do we have to wait for this to boil long do we have to wait for this to boil long do we have to wait for this to boil and get all sorted uh couple of minutes and get all sorted uh couple of minutes and get all sorted uh couple of minutes mhm should we do a little time lapse mhm should we do a little time lapse mhm should we do a little time lapse effect let's do that all effect let's do that all effect let's do that all right okay looks like we're boiling away right okay looks like we're boiling away right okay looks like we're boiling away furiously here is pretty good so uh it's furiously here is pretty good so uh it's furiously here is pretty good so uh it's about time to perform the experiment about time to perform the experiment about time to perform the experiment let's do it I but it might be a bit let's do it I but it might be a bit let's do it I but it might be a bit dramatic so I'm going to uh Chuck on a dramatic so I'm going to uh Chuck on a dramatic so I'm going to uh Chuck on a bit of gear safety glasses always bit of gear safety glasses always bit of gear safety glasses always important y and safety gloves to avoid important y and safety gloves to avoid important y and safety gloves to avoid burning your hands on this uh very hot burning your hands on this uh very hot burning your hands on this uh very hot drum that's right now uh you might want drum that's right now uh you might want drum that's right now uh you might want to you want to put those on I will you to you want to put those on I will you to you want to put those on I will you might want to stand back a bit cuz it's might want to stand back a bit cuz it's might want to stand back a bit cuz it's a little bit dramatic what happens all a little bit dramatic what happens all a little bit dramatic what happens all right let's do [Music] [Music] [Music] it get to there and get some cold water it get to there and get some cold water it get to there and get some cold water onto it all right so that water's turning it all right so that water's turning it all right so that water's turning back into water back into water back into water vapor oh my [Music] God [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what you look that's what you look that's what you look like with uh 3,000 Kg on your head like with uh 3,000 Kg on your head like with uh 3,000 Kg on your head 10,000 Kg on your whole 10,000 Kg on your whole 10,000 Kg on your whole body you know I was expecting I was body you know I was expecting I was body you know I was expecting I was expecting it to crumple like slowly over expecting it to crumple like slowly over expecting it to crumple like slowly over time I wasn't expecting it to just go time I wasn't expecting it to just go time I wasn't expecting it to just go all in once yeah well cuz it's CC little all in once yeah well cuz it's CC little all in once yeah well cuz it's CC little bit of it goes and the whole lot goes bit of it goes and the whole lot goes bit of it goes and the whole lot goes wow they're quite they're quite strong wow they're quite they're quite strong wow they're quite they're quite strong for a while yeah that was awesome yeah for a while yeah that was awesome yeah for a while yeah that was awesome yeah you can hear the air is trying to get you can hear the air is trying to get you can hear the air is trying to get back back back in in in ah and now the pressure is equalized ah and now the pressure is equalized ah and now the pressure is equalized there pressure is now requal that's there pressure is now requal that's there pressure is now requal that's right wow that's one hell of an right wow that's one hell of an right wow that's one hell of an experiment certainly is looks like you experiment certainly is looks like you experiment certainly is looks like you wet yourself that was so wet yourself that was so wet yourself that was so exciting that's partly exciting that's partly exciting that's partly [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] true
