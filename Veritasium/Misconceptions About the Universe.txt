WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en there was a time when the universe was there was a time when the universe was there was a time when the universe was expanding so rapidly the parts of it expanding so rapidly the parts of it expanding so rapidly the parts of it were moving apart from each other faster were moving apart from each other faster were moving apart from each other faster than the speed of light that time is than the speed of light that time is than the speed of light that time is right now a lot of people make a big right now a lot of people make a big right now a lot of people make a big deal out of the fact that during deal out of the fact that during deal out of the fact that during inflation right after our universe burst inflation right after our universe burst inflation right after our universe burst into existence the whole universe was into existence the whole universe was into existence the whole universe was expanding faster than light now while expanding faster than light now while expanding faster than light now while that is true that is true that is true it kind of implies that the universe it kind of implies that the universe it kind of implies that the universe doesn't normally do that and it does I doesn't normally do that and it does I doesn't normally do that and it does I mean if you pick two points far enough mean if you pick two points far enough mean if you pick two points far enough apart in our universe you can always apart in our universe you can always apart in our universe you can always find ones that are moving apart from find ones that are moving apart from find ones that are moving apart from each other faster than light that is each other faster than light that is each other faster than light that is simply due to all of the expanding space simply due to all of the expanding space simply due to all of the expanding space in between so our universe is now and in between so our universe is now and in between so our universe is now and has always been expanding faster than has always been expanding faster than has always been expanding faster than the speed of light but doesn't this the speed of light but doesn't this the speed of light but doesn't this violate Einstein's special theory of violate Einstein's special theory of violate Einstein's special theory of relativity that says nothing should be relativity that says nothing should be relativity that says nothing should be able to move faster than light able to move faster than light able to move faster than light actually no relativity says nothing can actually no relativity says nothing can actually no relativity says nothing can move through space faster than light but move through space faster than light but move through space faster than light but that doesn't stop space itself from that doesn't stop space itself from that doesn't stop space itself from expanding however it likes now it was expanding however it likes now it was expanding however it likes now it was Hubble in the late 1920s who made the Hubble in the late 1920s who made the Hubble in the late 1920s who made the observations of the night sky which led observations of the night sky which led observations of the night sky which led us to see that our universe is expanding us to see that our universe is expanding us to see that our universe is expanding the further out in space he looked the the further out in space he looked the the further out in space he looked the faster the objects were moving away from faster the objects were moving away from faster the objects were moving away from us so imagine a point so far out there us so imagine a point so far out there us so imagine a point so far out there that the average recession velocity is that the average recession velocity is that the average recession velocity is the speed of light I mean if you think the speed of light I mean if you think the speed of light I mean if you think about it it's going to be the same about it it's going to be the same about it it's going to be the same distance in every direction so that distance in every direction so that distance in every direction so that would form a sphere which we call the would form a sphere which we call the would form a sphere which we call the Hubble sphere everything beyond that Hubble sphere everything beyond that Hubble sphere everything beyond that sphere is moving away from us faster sphere is moving away from us faster sphere is moving away from us faster than the speed of light so common sense than the speed of light so common sense than the speed of light so common sense would say we would never be able to see would say we would never be able to see would say we would never be able to see the light from those objects because of the light from those objects because of the light from those objects because of how fast they're moving away from us but how fast they're moving away from us but how fast they're moving away from us but in fact this is not true we can see in fact this is not true we can see in fact this is not true we can see those objects to understand how this those objects to understand how this those objects to understand how this could work picture a galaxy beyond our could work picture a galaxy beyond our could work picture a galaxy beyond our Hubble sphere it's receding faster than Hubble sphere it's receding faster than Hubble sphere it's receding faster than light it's in a superluminal region of light it's in a superluminal region of light it's in a superluminal region of space from our perspective so any light space from our perspective so any light space from our perspective so any light that emits in that emits in that emits in our direction will actually be moving our direction will actually be moving our direction will actually be moving away from us as time goes on well that away from us as time goes on well that away from us as time goes on well that doesn't sound very promising but due to doesn't sound very promising but due to doesn't sound very promising but due to the accelerating expansion of space our the accelerating expansion of space our the accelerating expansion of space our Hubble sphere is actually getting bigger Hubble sphere is actually getting bigger Hubble sphere is actually getting bigger and if it gets bigger faster than that and if it gets bigger faster than that and if it gets bigger faster than that light can get away then at some point light can get away then at some point light can get away then at some point that light is going to travel from a that light is going to travel from a that light is going to travel from a superluminal region of space into a sub superluminal region of space into a sub superluminal region of space into a sub luminal region of space and so it can luminal region of space and so it can luminal region of space and so it can start making progress towards us so we start making progress towards us so we start making progress towards us so we can detect it so we can see that distant can detect it so we can see that distant can detect it so we can see that distant galaxies which is of course now even galaxies which is of course now even galaxies which is of course now even further beyond our Hubble sphere but we further beyond our Hubble sphere but we further beyond our Hubble sphere but we can see its light we can detect that can see its light we can detect that can see its light we can detect that it's there this is remarkable it's there this is remarkable it's there this is remarkable in fact all of the photons we now in fact all of the photons we now in fact all of the photons we now receive from the first 5 billion years receive from the first 5 billion years receive from the first 5 billion years of the universe they were all emitted in of the universe they were all emitted in of the universe they were all emitted in regions of space that were traveling at regions of space that were traveling at regions of space that were traveling at the time faster than the speed of light the time faster than the speed of light the time faster than the speed of light relative to us the objects that emitted relative to us the objects that emitted relative to us the objects that emitted them were are and always have been them were are and always have been them were are and always have been moving away from us faster than the moving away from us faster than the moving away from us faster than the speed of light but their light has speed of light but their light has speed of light but their light has entered our Hubble sphere and had enough entered our Hubble sphere and had enough entered our Hubble sphere and had enough time to reach us and so we can see them time to reach us and so we can see them time to reach us and so we can see them so the observable universe is larger so the observable universe is larger so the observable universe is larger than our Hubble sphere it's actually than our Hubble sphere it's actually than our Hubble sphere it's actually limited by what's called the particle limited by what's called the particle limited by what's called the particle horizon that is based on the amount of horizon that is based on the amount of horizon that is based on the amount of time light has had to travel towards us time light has had to travel towards us time light has had to travel towards us since the beginning of time that is 13.8 since the beginning of time that is 13.8 since the beginning of time that is 13.8 billion years ago as far as we can tell billion years ago as far as we can tell billion years ago as far as we can tell now because the universe has been now because the universe has been now because the universe has been expanding and that expansion has been expanding and that expansion has been expanding and that expansion has been accelerating things are much further out accelerating things are much further out accelerating things are much further out than 13.8 billion light years away I than 13.8 billion light years away I than 13.8 billion light years away I mean the observable universe has a mean the observable universe has a mean the observable universe has a radius of over 46 billion light-years radius of over 46 billion light-years radius of over 46 billion light-years the diameter is about 93 billion light the diameter is about 93 billion light the diameter is about 93 billion light years that is a huge volume of things years that is a huge volume of things years that is a huge volume of things that we can see and 13.8 billion years that we can see and 13.8 billion years that we can see and 13.8 billion years ago everything in that volume and ago everything in that volume and ago everything in that volume and everything beyond it that we can't see everything beyond it that we can't see everything beyond it that we can't see would have been compressed into a tiny would have been compressed into a tiny would have been compressed into a tiny infinitesimally small point that we call infinitesimally small point that we call infinitesimally small point that we call the singularity the singularity the singularity actually no I mean that would be true if actually no I mean that would be true if actually no I mean that would be true if the universe is finite but if the the universe is finite but if the the universe is finite but if the universe is infinite and it kind of universe is infinite and it kind of universe is infinite and it kind of looks like it is then it was always looks like it is then it was always looks like it is then it was always infinite so the Big Bang would have infinite so the Big Bang would have infinite so the Big Bang would have happened literally everywhere but if the happened literally everywhere but if the happened literally everywhere but if the universe has always been infinite then universe has always been infinite then universe has always been infinite then what is it expanding into well it what is it expanding into well it what is it expanding into well it doesn't have to expand into anything I doesn't have to expand into anything I doesn't have to expand into anything I mean it can expand into itself that's mean it can expand into itself that's mean it can expand into itself that's the thing about infinity you never run the thing about infinity you never run the thing about infinity you never run out of it this episode of veritasium was out
