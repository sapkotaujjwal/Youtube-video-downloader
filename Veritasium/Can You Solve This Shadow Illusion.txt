And what I want you to do is hole in it. And what I want you to do is hole in it. And what I want you to do is hold it up u and try to cast a shadow on hold it up u and try to cast a shadow on hold it up u and try to cast a shadow on that wall there. that wall there. that wall there. And I want you before you do it to And I want you before you do it to And I want you before you do it to predict what we're going to see. predict what we're going to see. predict what we're going to see. Shadow of the card. Shadow of the card. Shadow of the card. Shadow of the card. Shadow of the card. Shadow of the card. With a little hole in it. With a little hole in it. With a little hole in it. We will see that figure enlarged on the We will see that figure enlarged on the We will see that figure enlarged on the wall. wall. wall. It's not very pronounced, but you can It's not very pronounced, but you can It's not very pronounced, but you can actually do see the little hole in it. actually do see the little hole in it. actually do see the little hole in it. And of course me. And of course me. And of course me. So cool. Woohoo. My next question for So cool. Woohoo. My next question for So cool. Woohoo. My next question for you is we have this card. [snorts] you is we have this card. [snorts] you is we have this card. [snorts] What's that like? It's bigger hole. What's that like? It's bigger hole. What's that like? It's bigger hole. Can you tell me what size circle we're Can you tell me what size circle we're Can you tell me what size circle we're going to see? going to see? going to see? Like compared to the other one. Like compared to the other one. Like compared to the other one. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Like twice the size maybe. Like twice the size maybe. Like twice the size maybe. But still the card with the larger round But still the card with the larger round But still the card with the larger round hole. hole. hole. What do you see? What do you see? What do you see? Bigger hole. Bigger hole. Bigger hole. The card and the hole is slightly bigger The card and the hole is slightly bigger The card and the hole is slightly bigger than the previous one. than the previous one. than the previous one. They're the same thing just larger. They're the same thing just larger. They're the same thing just larger. Okay. What I want you to do Okay. What I want you to do Okay. What I want you to do the same size though. the same size though. the same size though. It's approximately the same size as the It's approximately the same size as the It's approximately the same size as the last one. last one. last one. Why don't we compare it? Here you go. Why don't we compare it? Here you go. Why don't we compare it? Here you go. You're right. It is. One's just fainter You're right. It is. One's just fainter You're right. It is. One's just fainter than the other. than the other. than the other. Oh goodness. It actually looks about the Oh goodness. It actually looks about the Oh goodness. It actually looks about the same. same. same. Same size hole. Same size hole. Same size hole. I can't believe that. It's must be the I can't believe that. It's must be the I can't believe that. It's must be the sun playing tricks with my mind. sun playing tricks with my mind. sun playing tricks with my mind. [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] What about here's really going to test What about here's really going to test What about here's really going to test you? Right. you? Right. you? Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh tell me about what's on that card. Uh tell me about what's on that card. Uh tell me about what's on that card. It's before you put it up. It's before you put it up. It's before you put it up. It's a triangle. It's a triangle. It's a triangle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So Okay. So Okay. So So what do you expect that we'll see on So what do you expect that we'll see on So what do you expect that we'll see on the wall? the wall? the wall? A triangle, but I wouldn't be surprised A triangle, but I wouldn't be surprised A triangle, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a circle. [laughter] if it was a circle. [laughter] if it was a circle. [laughter] What are we going to see? What are we going to see? What are we going to see? A triangle. A triangle. A triangle. I'm certain. I'm certain. I'm certain. Okay, let's have a look. Oh wow, that's Okay, let's have a look. Oh wow, that's Okay, let's have a look. Oh wow, that's awkward for me. awkward for me. awkward for me. It's a circle. It's a circle. It's a circle. It'll be a triangle. It'll be a triangle. It'll be a triangle. Well, we're not going to see a triangle. Well, we're not going to see a triangle. Well, we're not going to see a triangle. Why not? [laughter] Why not? [laughter] Why not? [laughter] Cuz everything else has been a circle, Cuz everything else has been a circle, Cuz everything else has been a circle, so it'll be a circle. so it'll be a circle. so it'll be a circle. I'm sticking to triangle. I'm sticking to triangle. I'm sticking to triangle. Okay, it's a circle. Okay, it's a circle. Okay, it's a circle. Let's have a look. Now I'm interested. Let's have a look. Now I'm interested. Let's have a look. Now I'm interested. Well, there you go. It's a circle. Well, there you go. It's a circle. Well, there you go. It's a circle. Do you want to compare it to the one of Do you want to compare it to the one of Do you want to compare it to the one of the others? I'll give you the bigger the others? I'll give you the bigger the others? I'll give you the bigger one. The bigger one. The bigger one. one. The bigger one. The bigger one. one. The bigger one. The bigger one. Oh my goodness. I really like this Oh my goodness. I really like this Oh my goodness. I really like this project. I'm learning something. The sun project. I'm learning something. The sun project. I'm learning something. The sun is definitely playing tricks in my mind. is definitely playing tricks in my mind. is definitely playing tricks in my mind. The sun is deceptive. The sun is deceptive. The sun is deceptive. That's weird. That's weird. That's weird. Why Why are we seeing circles with all Why Why are we seeing circles with all Why Why are we seeing circles with all these cards regardless of the shape of these cards regardless of the shape of these cards regardless of the shape of the hole? the hole? the hole? I really don't know. I'd like to know. I really don't know. I'd like to know. I really don't know. I'd like to know. When you take away the definition from When you take away the definition from When you take away the definition from any kind of shape, it ends up being just any kind of shape, it ends up being just any kind of shape, it ends up being just round to our eyes. round to our eyes. round to our eyes. There, for example, you get a perfect There, for example, you get a perfect There, for example, you get a perfect triangle. triangle. triangle. But it was a pretty decent circle from But it was a pretty decent circle from But it was a pretty decent circle from back. back. back. So, it must you must get to a certain So, it must you must get to a certain So, it must you must get to a certain size here. It doesn't matter what what size here. It doesn't matter what what size here. It doesn't matter what what shape it is. It's just turned back shape it is. It's just turned back shape it is. It's just turned back probably. probably. probably. Why is it going to a circle though? Why is it going to a circle though? Why is it going to a circle though? When you look at the sun, it looks sort When you look at the sun, it looks sort When you look at the sun, it looks sort of round, doesn't it? So, I'm not sure of round, doesn't it? So, I'm not sure of round, doesn't it? So, I'm not sure if that's got anything to do with it. if that's got anything to do with it. if that's got anything to do with it. Well, the light is going through these Well, the light is going through these Well, the light is going through these little holes and it is the sun. The sun little holes and it is the sun. The sun little holes and it is the sun. The sun rays just sort of um going through those rays just sort of um going through those rays just sort of um going through those little holes making circle of the sun. I little holes making circle of the sun. I little holes making circle of the sun. I don't know. You tell me. don't know. You tell me. don't know. You tell me. Exactly. You nailed it. What we're Exactly. You nailed it. What we're Exactly. You nailed it. What we're looking at there is actually an image of looking at there is actually an image of looking at there is actually an image of the sun. the sun. the sun. Really? Really? Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. The earth's round and the sun's round. The earth's round and the sun's round. The earth's round and the sun's round. Yeah. The [laughter] sun the sun's Yeah. The [laughter] sun the sun's Yeah. The [laughter] sun the sun's round. I guess round. I guess round. I guess the building's round. the building's round. the building's round. The building's round, is it? No, the The building's round, is it? No, the The building's round, is it? No, the building's not round. building's not round. building's not round. So, what we're seeing is So, what we're seeing is So, what we're seeing is a projection of the sun. a projection of the sun. a projection of the sun. I've never thought about it before. I've never thought about it before. I've never thought about it before. I think that you actually know. And I I think that you actually know. And I I think that you actually know. And I think you have actually thought about it think you have actually thought about it think you have actually thought about it [laughter] before, but I think you're [laughter] before, but I think you're [laughter] before, but I think you're not queuing that right part of your not queuing that right part of your not queuing that right part of your brain that knows the answer. brain that knows the answer. brain that knows the answer. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably. There's a part of your brain that knows There's a part of your brain that knows There's a part of your brain that knows the answer. the answer. the answer. Well, I did photography at school. Um, Well, I did photography at school. Um, Well, I did photography at school. Um, and we did pinhole cameras. The hole and we did pinhole cameras. The hole and we did pinhole cameras. The hole actually reflects what it's showing actually reflects what it's showing actually reflects what it's showing on the wall. So what? on the wall. So what? on the wall. So what? So you see what you see on the other So you see what you see on the other So you see what you see on the other side. side. side. So what's that? So what's that? So what's that? So it's the sun. So it's the sun. So it's the sun. Well, there you go. I've [laughter] Well, there you go. I've [laughter] Well, there you go. I've [laughter] learned something today, Derek.
