you haven't heard of it you should uh definitely check it out one should uh definitely check it out one should uh definitely check it out one guy uh s KH has made uh thousands of guy uh s KH has made uh thousands of guy uh s KH has made uh thousands of videos over 2,200 at the moment uh on videos over 2,200 at the moment uh on videos over 2,200 at the moment uh on everything from uh math to uh history everything from uh math to uh history everything from uh math to uh history and uh also quite a few and uh also quite a few and uh also quite a few videos about science and uh there are a lot of things science and uh there are a lot of things science and uh there are a lot of things to love about uh Con Academy first of to love about uh Con Academy first of to love about uh Con Academy first of all everything's freely available all everything's freely available all everything's freely available through YouTube um Khan's goal is to uh through YouTube um Khan's goal is to uh through YouTube um Khan's goal is to uh improve the education for all students improve the education for all students improve the education for all students and he is an exceptional teacher uh an and he is an exceptional teacher uh an and he is an exceptional teacher uh an absolutely fantastic uh speaker he also absolutely fantastic uh speaker he also absolutely fantastic uh speaker he also emphasizes Mastery which I think is very emphasizes Mastery which I think is very emphasizes Mastery which I think is very important so um students in the program important so um students in the program important so um students in the program can only move on after uh completing 10 can only move on after uh completing 10 can only move on after uh completing 10 questions in a row correctly questions in a row correctly questions in a row correctly and he's also developed some activities and he's also developed some activities and he's also developed some activities and software and he's working with and software and he's working with and software and he's working with schools to try to humanize the classroom schools to try to humanize the classroom schools to try to humanize the classroom to try to um uh help improve the quality to try to um uh help improve the quality to try to um uh help improve the quality of student teacher time and he's pushing of student teacher time and he's pushing of student teacher time and he's pushing uh the learning well beyond uh the video uh the learning well beyond uh the video uh the learning well beyond uh the video area uh but I want to put that work area uh but I want to put that work area uh but I want to put that work aside for a moment and uh just focus on aside for a moment and uh just focus on aside for a moment and uh just focus on the millions of viewers who watch his the millions of viewers who watch his the millions of viewers who watch his science videos online you see I'm science videos online you see I'm science videos online you see I'm skeptical that they actually promote skeptical that they actually promote skeptical that they actually promote some meaning meanful learning and that's some meaning meanful learning and that's some meaning meanful learning and that's not just a comment about Khan's videos not just a comment about Khan's videos not just a comment about Khan's videos but a comment on science videos in but a comment on science videos in but a comment on science videos in general so let me explain that general so let me explain that general so let me explain that skepticism I wrote my PhD thesis on how skepticism I wrote my PhD thesis on how skepticism I wrote my PhD thesis on how to create films to teach science to create films to teach science to create films to teach science specifically physics in a typical study specifically physics in a typical study specifically physics in a typical study students accessed a website where they students accessed a website where they students accessed a website where they took a multiple choice pre- test the took a multiple choice pre- test the took a multiple choice pre- test the questions were something like consider a questions were something like consider a questions were something like consider a basketball player shooting from the free basketball player shooting from the free basketball player shooting from the free throw line after the ball leaves his throw line after the ball leaves his throw line after the ball leaves his hand the force on the ball is a upwards hand the force on the ball is a upwards hand the force on the ball is a upwards and constant B upwards and decreasing C and constant B upwards and decreasing C and constant B upwards and decreasing C downwards and constant D downwards and downwards and constant D downwards and downwards and constant D downwards and decreasing or E tangent to the path of decreasing or E tangent to the path of decreasing or E tangent to the path of the the the ball take a minute to think about which ball take a minute to think about which ball take a minute to think about which answer you would pick and what you think answer you would pick and what you think answer you would pick and what you think most other people would pick after the most other people would pick after the most other people would pick after the preest students were randomly assigned preest students were randomly assigned preest students were randomly assigned to see one of several online videos the to see one of several online videos the to see one of several online videos the videos contain correct answers to many videos contain correct answers to many videos contain correct answers to many of the pre-test questions for example of the pre-test questions for example of the pre-test questions for example here is a here is a here is a clip now we'll consider a case where clip now we'll consider a case where clip now we'll consider a case where gravitational force is the only force gravitational force is the only force gravitational force is the only force acting on an acting on an acting on an object while a juggling ball is in the object while a juggling ball is in the object while a juggling ball is in the air we'll ignore air resistance because air we'll ignore air resistance because air we'll ignore air resistance because it's so small only one force acts on the it's so small only one force acts on the it's so small only one force acts on the ball throughout its ball throughout its ball throughout its flight this is the force of gravity flight this is the force of gravity flight this is the force of gravity which is constant and which is constant and which is constant and downwards gravity accelerates the ball downwards gravity accelerates the ball downwards gravity accelerates the ball in the downwards Direction after being in the downwards Direction after being in the downwards Direction after being thrown up a ball travels slow and slower thrown up a ball travels slow and slower thrown up a ball travels slow and slower upwards its velocity goes through zero upwards its velocity goes through zero upwards its velocity goes through zero and then it speeds up in the downward and then it speeds up in the downward and then it speeds up in the downward Direction the whole time the ball is Direction the whole time the ball is Direction the whole time the ball is accelerating downwards then it meets the accelerating downwards then it meets the accelerating downwards then it meets the juggler's hand immediately after watching the hand immediately after watching the hand immediately after watching the roughly 10-minute video the students roughly 10-minute video the students roughly 10-minute video the students took exactly the same took exactly the same took exactly the same test I also interviewed some students to test I also interviewed some students to test I also interviewed some students to see what they thought of the video the see what they thought of the video the see what they thought of the video the most common comments were that it was most common comments were that it was most common comments were that it was clear concise and easy to understand the clear concise and easy to understand the clear concise and easy to understand the students also increased their confidence students also increased their confidence students also increased their confidence in the correctness of their answers in the correctness of their answers in the correctness of their answers compared to the preest so what about how compared to the preest so what about how compared to the preest so what about how much they learned on the preest the much they learned on the preest the much they learned on the preest the average score was 6.0 out of 26 and average score was 6.0 out of 26 and average score was 6.0 out of 26 and after the video the average was after the video the average was after the video the average was 6.3 well what was going on I dug deep in 6.3 well what was going on I dug deep in 6.3 well what was going on I dug deep in interviews to find out it turned out interviews to find out it turned out interviews to find out it turned out students did not even correctly remember students did not even correctly remember students did not even correctly remember what was presented in the video that what was presented in the video that what was presented in the video that they had seen a few minutes earlier one they had seen a few minutes earlier one they had seen a few minutes earlier one recalled in the video it said the ball recalled in the video it said the ball recalled in the video it said the ball is slowly decreasing in force so is slowly decreasing in force so is slowly decreasing in force so therefore it stops at one point and then therefore it stops at one point and then therefore it stops at one point and then comes down what was worse another told comes down what was worse another told comes down what was worse another told me it wasn't that hard to pay attention me it wasn't that hard to pay attention me it wasn't that hard to pay attention to because I knew already what she was to because I knew already what she was to because I knew already what she was talking about I hadn't told them about talking about I hadn't told them about talking about I hadn't told them about this 6 out of 26 yet so I was listening this 6 out of 26 yet so I was listening this 6 out of 26 yet so I was listening but I wasn't really paying utmost but I wasn't really paying utmost but I wasn't really paying utmost attention what can be done about this attention what can be done about this attention what can be done about this perhaps videos are just too pass of a perhaps videos are just too pass of a perhaps videos are just too pass of a medium to attract attention for 10 medium to attract attention for 10 medium to attract attention for 10 minutes even when you know you're being minutes even when you know you're being minutes even when you know you're being interviewed after but I see the the interviewed after but I see the the interviewed after but I see the the problem a different way typically we problem a different way typically we problem a different way typically we think of Education as informing students think of Education as informing students think of Education as informing students about things they uh are not aware of about things they uh are not aware of about things they uh are not aware of like the French Revolution for example like the French Revolution for example like the French Revolution for example but science presents a different but science presents a different but science presents a different challenge it is not that students know challenge it is not that students know challenge it is not that students know nothing about it but that they already nothing about it but that they already nothing about it but that they already have plenty of ideas most of which are have plenty of ideas most of which are have plenty of ideas most of which are unfortunately wrong scientifically unfortunately wrong scientifically unfortunately wrong scientifically speaking they don't pay attention speaking they don't pay attention speaking they don't pay attention because they think they know it and then because they think they know it and then because they think they know it and then when asked what they saw they falsely when asked what they saw they falsely when asked what they saw they falsely remember their own ideas as what was remember their own ideas as what was remember their own ideas as what was presented is is there a way to overcome presented is is there a way to overcome presented is is there a way to overcome this well I thought students might pay this well I thought students might pay this well I thought students might pay more attention and be able to understand more attention and be able to understand more attention and be able to understand if their ideas were presented in the if their ideas were presented in the if their ideas were presented in the video so one of the other videos video so one of the other videos video so one of the other videos involved an actor pretending to be a involved an actor pretending to be a involved an actor pretending to be a student with the most common student with the most common student with the most common misconceptions which were Illustrated can you tell me what happens Illustrated can you tell me what happens Illustrated can you tell me what happens when a single ball goes around once well when a single ball goes around once well when a single ball goes around once well Luke's hand gives the ball a force that Luke's hand gives the ball a force that Luke's hand gives the ball a force that drives it upwards Against Gravity but as drives it upwards Against Gravity but as drives it upwards Against Gravity but as it goes up this Force gradually dies it goes up this Force gradually dies it goes up this Force gradually dies away until at the very top it perfectly away until at the very top it perfectly away until at the very top it perfectly balances gravity and then gravity wins balances gravity and then gravity wins balances gravity and then gravity wins and the ball falls down and the ball falls down and the ball falls down H he then discussed with the other H he then discussed with the other H he then discussed with the other dialogue participant why the dialogue participant why the dialogue participant why the misconception didn't work and how the misconception didn't work and how the misconception didn't work and how the scientific idea differed in interviews scientific idea differed in interviews scientific idea differed in interviews with students who watched this video no with students who watched this video no with students who watched this video no one used the words clear concise or easy one used the words clear concise or easy one used the words clear concise or easy to understand most often they said it to understand most often they said it to understand most often they said it was confusing but on the post test the was confusing but on the post test the was confusing but on the post test the average score nearly doubled to 11 out average score nearly doubled to 11 out average score nearly doubled to 11 out of of of 26 when asked to rate how much mental 26 when asked to rate how much mental 26 when asked to rate how much mental effort they invested in watching the effort they invested in watching the effort they invested in watching the videos students who saw the dialogue videos students who saw the dialogue videos students who saw the dialogue with misconceptions averaged a whole with misconceptions averaged a whole with misconceptions averaged a whole point higher than those who saw the point higher than those who saw the point higher than those who saw the explanation without misconceptions and explanation without misconceptions and explanation without misconceptions and it seems like it worked that increased it seems like it worked that increased it seems like it worked that increased mental effort translated into more mental effort translated into more mental effort translated into more learning so with the veritasium films I learning so with the veritasium films I learning so with the veritasium films I always try to start with the always try to start with the always try to start with the misconceptions how long does it take for misconceptions how long does it take for misconceptions how long does it take for the earth to go around the the earth to go around the the earth to go around the Sun well Sun well Sun well obviously a die yes this is H obviously a die yes this is H obviously a die yes this is H representing the Earth okay and this representing the Earth okay and this representing the Earth okay and this represents what do you think yes how far represents what do you think yes how far represents what do you think yes how far apart are they like roughly like roughly apart are they like roughly like roughly apart are they like roughly like roughly that much is the following statement that much is the following statement that much is the following statement true or false humans lived at the same true or false humans lived at the same true or false humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs I'll say true we really have dinosaurs I'll say true we really have dinosaurs I'll say true we really have to tackle these misconceptions somehow to tackle these misconceptions somehow to tackle these misconceptions somehow it seems if you just present the correct it seems if you just present the correct it seems if you just present the correct information five things happen number information five things happen number information five things happen number one students think they know it two they one students think they know it two they one students think they know it two they don't pay their utmost attention three don't pay their utmost attention three don't pay their utmost attention three they don't recognize that what is they don't recognize that what is they don't recognize that what is presented is different to what they're presented is different to what they're presented is different to what they're already thinking and four they don't already thinking and four they don't already thinking and four they don't learn a thing and finally five perhaps learn a thing and finally five perhaps learn a thing and finally five perhaps most troublingly they get more confident most troublingly they get more confident most troublingly they get more confident in the ideas they were thinking before in the ideas they were thinking before in the ideas they were thinking before and this is a vicious cycle that we have and this is a vicious cycle that we have and this is a vicious cycle that we have to find a way to break in order to have to find a way to break in order to have to find a way to break in order to have effective Science Education so the con effective Science Education so the con effective Science Education so the con videos are amazing and definitely a videos are amazing and definitely a videos are amazing and definitely a valuable resource for science Educators valuable resource for science Educators valuable resource for science Educators and perhaps people looking for a bit of and perhaps people looking for a bit of and perhaps people looking for a bit of review but for those who are just review but for those who are just review but for those who are just starting to learn science I question starting to learn science I question starting to learn science I question whether it's going to be that valuable whether it's going to be that valuable whether it's going to be that valuable because it doesn't really question their misconceptions he the Earth doesn't take misconceptions he the Earth doesn't take misconceptions he the Earth doesn't take one day to get around the one day to get around the one day to get around the sun it's actually ye Jo put your
