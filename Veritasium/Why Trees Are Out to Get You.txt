potentially the largest collaboration ever on YouTube along with my friends ever on YouTube along with my friends ever on YouTube along with my friends mr. beast and mark Rober Destin from mr. beast and mark Rober Destin from mr. beast and mark Rober Destin from smarter every day and many many others smarter every day and many many others smarter every day and many many others we're trying to get 20 million trees we're trying to get 20 million trees we're trying to get 20 million trees planted before the end of this year and planted before the end of this year and planted before the end of this year and each tree costs $1 so essentially we're each tree costs $1 so essentially we're each tree costs $1 so essentially we're trying to raise 20 million dollars if trying to raise 20 million dollars if trying to raise 20 million dollars if you want to help us get to that target you want to help us get to that target you want to help us get to that target well then go to team trees org and well then go to team trees org and well then go to team trees org and donate now most of the youtubers are donate now most of the youtubers are donate now most of the youtubers are making original videos for this making original videos for this making original videos for this collaboration but since I'm obviously collaboration but since I'm obviously collaboration but since I'm obviously currently travelling in Sydney I don't currently travelling in Sydney I don't currently travelling in Sydney I don't have time for that so I am reposting one have time for that so I am reposting one have time for that so I am reposting one of my favorite videos of all time which of my favorite videos of all time which of my favorite videos of all time which is about trees and how they bend the is about trees and how they bend the is about trees and how they bend the laws of physics and do things that laws of physics and do things that laws of physics and do things that engineers and scientists can't yet engineers and scientists can't yet engineers and scientists can't yet replicate so if you haven't seen that replicate so if you haven't seen that replicate so if you haven't seen that please check it out sometimes the please check it out sometimes the please check it out sometimes the simplest questions have the most amazing simplest questions have the most amazing simplest questions have the most amazing answers like how can trees be so tall answers like how can trees be so tall answers like how can trees be so tall it's a question that doesn't even seem it's a question that doesn't even seem it's a question that doesn't even seem like it needs an answer trees just are like it needs an answer trees just are like it needs an answer trees just are tall some of them are over a hundred tall some of them are over a hundred tall some of them are over a hundred meters Why should there be a height meters Why should there be a height meters Why should there be a height limit I'll tell you why trees need to limit I'll tell you why trees need to limit I'll tell you why trees need to transport water from their roots up transport water from their roots up transport water from their roots up until their topmost branches in order to until their topmost branches in order to until their topmost branches in order to survive and that is no trivial task survive and that is no trivial task survive and that is no trivial task there is a limit to the height that there is a limit to the height that there is a limit to the height that water can be sucked up a tube it's ten water can be sucked up a tube it's ten water can be sucked up a tube it's ten meters if you suck on a long vertical meters if you suck on a long vertical meters if you suck on a long vertical straw the water will go no higher than straw the water will go no higher than straw the water will go no higher than 10 meters at this point there will be a 10 meters at this point there will be a 10 meters at this point there will be a perfect vacuum at the top of the straw perfect vacuum at the top of the straw perfect vacuum at the top of the straw and the water will start to boil and the water will start to boil and the water will start to boil spontaneously for a tree to raise water spontaneously for a tree to raise water spontaneously for a tree to raise water a hundred meters it would have to create a hundred meters it would have to create a hundred meters it would have to create a pressure difference of ten atmospheres a pressure difference of ten atmospheres a pressure difference of ten atmospheres how would trees do that when I posed how would trees do that when I posed how would trees do that when I posed this conundrum a lot of people said the this conundrum a lot of people said the this conundrum a lot of people said the answer is transpiration and that's when answer is transpiration and that's when answer is transpiration and that's when water evaporates from the leaf pulling water evaporates from the leaf pulling water evaporates from the leaf pulling up the water molecules behind it and up the water molecules behind it and up the water molecules behind it and that's clearly a mechanism a tree can that's clearly a mechanism a tree can that's clearly a mechanism a tree can use to create suction but it doesn't use to create suction but it doesn't use to create suction but it doesn't help us overcome this 10 meter limit help us overcome this 10 meter limit help us overcome this 10 meter limit below as the pressure can go as if your below as the pressure can go as if your below as the pressure can go as if your vacuum which I imagine is not happening vacuum which I imagine is not happening vacuum which I imagine is not happening instead of tree leaves right right Hank instead of tree leaves right right Hank instead of tree leaves right right Hank so you might suspect that a tree does so you might suspect that a tree does so you might suspect that a tree does not contain continuous straw like tubes not contain continuous straw like tubes not contain continuous straw like tubes the tree effectively has vowels in it so the tree effectively has vowels in it so the tree effectively has vowels in it so you don't have a column of water this you don't have a column of water this you don't have a column of water this big - what you're saying needs to be big - what you're saying needs to be big - what you're saying needs to be filled with water there's actually made filled with water there's actually made filled with water there's actually made up of cells although these are good up of cells although these are good up of cells although these are good speculations they don't speculations they don't speculations they don't to be correct scientists who study trees to be correct scientists who study trees to be correct scientists who study trees find that the xylem tubes that transport find that the xylem tubes that transport find that the xylem tubes that transport water do contain a continuous water water do contain a continuous water water do contain a continuous water column so how else could the tree column so how else could the tree column so how else could the tree transport water from the roots to the transport water from the roots to the transport water from the roots to the leaves they don't suck they don't use a leaves they don't suck they don't use a leaves they don't suck they don't use a vacuum okay vacuum okay vacuum okay so how do they do it wheezing like a cow so how do they do it wheezing like a cow so how do they do it wheezing like a cow like you're squeezing the cow water all like you're squeezing the cow water all like you're squeezing the cow water all the way up there's little three mussels the way up there's little three mussels the way up there's little three mussels in there yeah besides being a giant in there yeah besides being a giant in there yeah besides being a giant waste of energy all of the cells that waste of energy all of the cells that waste of energy all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes are dead what make up the xylem tubes are dead what make up the xylem tubes are dead what about osmotic pressure if there is more about osmotic pressure if there is more about osmotic pressure if there is more solute in the roots than in the solute in the roots than in the solute in the roots than in the surrounding soil water would be pushed surrounding soil water would be pushed surrounding soil water would be pushed up the tree but some trees live in up the tree but some trees live in up the tree but some trees live in mangroves where the water is so salty mangroves where the water is so salty mangroves where the water is so salty that osmotic pressure actually acts in that osmotic pressure actually acts in that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other direction the other direction the other direction so the tree needs additional pressure to so the tree needs additional pressure to so the tree needs additional pressure to suck water into the tree then it must be suck water into the tree then it must be suck water into the tree then it must be capillary action capillary action capillary action the thinner the tube the higher the the thinner the tube the higher the the thinner the tube the higher the water can climb but the tubes in a tree water can climb but the tubes in a tree water can climb but the tubes in a tree are too wide at 20 to 200 micro meters are too wide at 20 to 200 micro meters are too wide at 20 to 200 micro meters in diameter water should rise less than in diameter water should rise less than in diameter water should rise less than a meter so how do trees do it well one a meter so how do trees do it well one a meter so how do trees do it well one of the assumptions we made is wrong of the assumptions we made is wrong of the assumptions we made is wrong below if the pressure can go is the pure below if the pressure can go is the pure below if the pressure can go is the pure vacuum your vacuum you're back in a gas vacuum your vacuum you're back in a gas vacuum your vacuum you're back in a gas this is true when you eliminate all of this is true when you eliminate all of this is true when you eliminate all of the gas molecules the pressure is zero the gas molecules the pressure is zero the gas molecules the pressure is zero and you have a perfect vacuum but in a and you have a perfect vacuum but in a and you have a perfect vacuum but in a liquid you can go lower than zero liquid you can go lower than zero liquid you can go lower than zero pressure and actually get negative pressure and actually get negative pressure and actually get negative pressures in a solid we would think of pressures in a solid we would think of pressures in a solid we would think of this as tension this means that the this as tension this means that the this as tension this means that the molecules are pulling on each other and molecules are pulling on each other and molecules are pulling on each other and their surroundings as the water their surroundings as the water their surroundings as the water evaporates from the pores of the cell evaporates from the pores of the cell evaporates from the pores of the cell wall they create immense negative wall they create immense negative wall they create immense negative pressures of minus 15 atmospheres in an pressures of minus 15 atmospheres in an pressures of minus 15 atmospheres in an average tree think about the air water average tree think about the air water average tree think about the air water interface at the pore there is one interface at the pore there is one interface at the pore there is one atmosphere of pressure pushing in and atmosphere of pressure pushing in and atmosphere of pressure pushing in and negative 15 atmospheres of suction on negative 15 atmospheres of suction on negative 15 atmospheres of suction on the other side so why doesn't the the other side so why doesn't the the other side so why doesn't the meniscus break because the pores are meniscus break because the pores are meniscus break because the pores are tiny only two to five nanometers in tiny only two to five nanometers in tiny only two to five nanometers in diameter at this scale waters high diameter at this scale waters high diameter at this scale waters high surface tension ensures the air water surface tension ensures the air water surface tension ensures the air water boundary can withstand huge pressures boundary can withstand huge pressures boundary can withstand huge pressures without caving as you move down the tree without caving as you move down the tree without caving as you move down the tree the pressure increases up to atmospheric the pressure increases up to atmospheric the pressure increases up to atmospheric at the roots so you can have a large at the roots so you can have a large at the roots so you can have a large pressure difference between the top and pressure difference between the top and pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the tree because the the bottom of the tree because the the bottom of the tree because the pressure at the top is so negative but pressure at the top is so negative but pressure at the top is so negative but hang on if the pressure at the top is hang on if the pressure at the top is hang on if the pressure at the top is negative 15 atmospheres shouldn't the negative 15 atmospheres shouldn't the negative 15 atmospheres shouldn't the water be boiling yes water be boiling yes water be boiling yes yes it should but changing phase from yes it should but changing phase from yes it should but changing phase from liquid to gas requires activation energy liquid to gas requires activation energy liquid to gas requires activation energy and that can come in the form of a and that can come in the form of a and that can come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny air bubble nucleation site like a tiny air bubble nucleation site like a tiny air bubble that's why it's so important that the that's why it's so important that the that's why it's so important that the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they can do this because unlike a straw they can do this because unlike a straw they can do this because unlike a straw they've been water filled from the start they've been water filled from the start they've been water filled from the start this way water remains in the metastable this way water remains in the metastable this way water remains in the metastable liquid state when it really should be liquid state when it really should be liquid state when it really should be boiling it's just like supercooled water boiling it's just like supercooled water boiling it's just like supercooled water remains liquid even though it should be remains liquid even though it should be remains liquid even though it should be ice so you could say that the water in a ice so you could say that the water in a ice so you could say that the water in a tree is super sucked because it remains tree is super sucked because it remains tree is super sucked because it remains liquid at such negative pressures and liquid at such negative pressures and liquid at such negative pressures and why are trees moving all this water up why are trees moving all this water up why are trees moving all this water up the tree I want you to make a guess say the tree I want you to make a guess say the tree I want you to make a guess say it out loud for photosynthesis actually it out loud for photosynthesis actually it out loud for photosynthesis actually no less than 1% of the water is used in no less than 1% of the water is used in no less than 1% of the water is used in photosynthetic reactions any other ideas photosynthetic reactions any other ideas photosynthetic reactions any other ideas okay what about growth well five percent okay what about growth well five percent okay what about growth well five percent of the water is used to make new cells of the water is used to make new cells of the water is used to make new cells so what happens to the other 95 percent so what happens to the other 95 percent so what happens to the other 95 percent of the water it just evaporates for each of the water it just evaporates for each of the water it just evaporates for each molecule of carbon dioxide that tree molecule of carbon dioxide that tree molecule of carbon dioxide that tree takes in it loses hundreds of molecules takes in it loses hundreds of molecules takes in it loses hundreds of molecules of water of water of water whoa can you believe how amazing this is whoa can you believe how amazing this is whoa can you believe how amazing this is trees create huge negative pressures of trees create huge negative pressures of trees create huge negative pressures of tens of atmospheres by evaporating water tens of atmospheres by evaporating water tens of atmospheres by evaporating water through nanoscale pores sucking water up through nanoscale pores sucking water up through nanoscale pores sucking water up a hundred meters in a state where it a hundred meters in a state where it a hundred meters in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the should be boiling but can't because the should be boiling but can't because the perfect xylem tubes contain no air perfect xylem tubes contain no air perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles just so that most of it can bubbles just so that most of it can bubbles just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a evaporate in the process of absorbing a evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide I couple molecules of carbon dioxide I couple molecules of carbon dioxide I will never look at trees the same way will never look at trees the same way will never look at trees the same way again [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] trees are some of the biggest organisms trees are some of the biggest organisms trees are some of the biggest organisms on the planet but where do they get that on the planet but where do they get that on the planet but where do they get that matter to grow which nutrients a it the matter to grow which nutrients a it the matter to grow which nutrients a it the grain status or any yeah goodness said grain status or any yeah goodness said grain status or any yeah goodness said of the soil I suppose comes out of this of the soil I suppose comes out of this of the soil I suppose comes out of this soil yeah soil yeah soil yeah goodness goodness why isn't there a big goodness goodness why isn't there a big goodness goodness why isn't there a big hole around the tree where it's taken hole around the tree where it's taken hole around the tree where it's taken out all the soil does it's a gradually out all the soil does it's a gradually out all the soil does it's a gradually let the soil has time to recover now I let the soil has time to recover now I let the soil has time to recover now I think it's intuitive to believe that the think it's intuitive to believe that the think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil tree gets most of its mass from the soil tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots digging because you can see those roots digging because you can see those roots digging into the soil and they must be taking into the soil and they must be taking into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean a tree something out of there and I mean a tree something out of there and I mean a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like looks like dirt and it feels solid like looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not in the early 1600s a dirt but it's not in the early 1600s a dirt but it's not in the early 1600s a scientist named Johann Baptiste event scientist named Johann Baptiste event scientist named Johann Baptiste event Helmholtz tried to figure out where the Helmholtz tried to figure out where the Helmholtz tried to figure out where the mass of a tree was coming from so he got mass of a tree was coming from so he got mass of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully a pot of soil and very carefully a pot of soil and very carefully measured the amount of soil in there measured the amount of soil in there measured the amount of soil in there then he planted the tree and took care then he planted the tree and took care then he planted the tree and took care of it for five years making sure that no of it for five years making sure that no of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot and at soil left or was added to his pot and at soil left or was added to his pot and at the end of this experiment he laid the the end of this experiment he laid the the end of this experiment he laid the tree to find that it was 72 kilograms tree to find that it was 72 kilograms tree to find that it was 72 kilograms but the mass of soil had only decreased but the mass of soil had only decreased but the mass of soil had only decreased by about 60 grams this was pretty strong by about 60 grams this was pretty strong by about 60 grams this was pretty strong evidence that the mass of the tree does evidence that the mass of the tree does evidence that the mass of the tree does not come from the soil I've never not come from the soil I've never not come from the soil I've never thought about that actually because they thought about that actually because they thought about that actually because they don't really eat anything don't really eat anything don't really eat anything don't eat me no no they don't eat don't eat me no no they don't eat don't eat me no no they don't eat anything water it's always absorb that's anything water it's always absorb that's anything water it's always absorb that's all they eat yeah they don't eat all they eat yeah they don't eat all they eat yeah they don't eat anything else no that's all they eat anything else no that's all they eat anything else no that's all they eat well presumably from the water and the well presumably from the water and the well presumably from the water and the nutrients from the soil is there nutrients from the soil is there nutrients from the soil is there anything else that you need besides the anything else that you need besides the anything else that you need besides the soil and the water this will be late soil and the water this will be late soil and the water this will be late isn't it to make other than the original isn't it to make other than the original isn't it to make other than the original seed for that particular trail the seed seed for that particular trail the seed seed for that particular trail the seed and the soil and the water and that and the soil and the water and that and the soil and the water and that makes this big tree of course makes this big tree of course makes this big tree of course Johann Baptista van Helmholtz did Johann Baptista van Helmholtz did Johann Baptista van Helmholtz did conclude that the tree was made entirely conclude that the tree was made entirely conclude that the tree was made entirely of water now while that's not correct at of water now while that's not correct at of water now while that's not correct at least he was on the right track least he was on the right track least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree realizing that the matter of a tree realizing that the matter of a tree doesn't come out of the soil the Sun doesn't come out of the soil the Sun doesn't come out of the soil the Sun energy yeah energy yeah energy yeah the Sun energy are they converting the Sun energy are they converting the Sun energy are they converting energy into maths or do you know what I energy into maths or do you know what I energy into maths or do you know what I mean yeah like that there wasn't there mean yeah like that there wasn't there mean yeah like that there wasn't there wasn't stuff and then there was like wasn't stuff and then there was like wasn't stuff and then there was like where did that stuff come from my where did that stuff come from my where did that stuff come from my question is where do they get that mass question is where do they get that mass question is where do they get that mass to grow big it from the rain and the Sun to grow big it from the rain and the Sun to grow big it from the rain and the Sun presumably like a sunlight and the presumably like a sunlight and the presumably like a sunlight and the sunshine the sunshine does it does the sunshine the sunshine does it does the sunshine the sunshine does it does the sunshine add mass to the trip well it sunshine add mass to the trip well it sunshine add mass to the trip well it yes it wouldn't they wouldn't grow yes it wouldn't they wouldn't grow yes it wouldn't they wouldn't grow without it I don't know they'd adds mass without it I don't know they'd adds mass without it I don't know they'd adds mass but they wouldn't grow without it of but they wouldn't grow without it of but they wouldn't grow without it of course the sun's energy is needed for course the sun's energy is needed for course the sun's energy is needed for the tree to build the matter into its the tree to build the matter into its the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself branches and leaves but the Sun itself branches and leaves but the Sun itself the energy is not matter oxi didn't the trees need the arcs are oxi didn't the trees need the arcs are oxi didn't the trees need the arcs are indeed the earth and I guess oxygen the indeed the earth and I guess oxygen the indeed the earth and I guess oxygen the oxygen of course the oxygen are there oxygen of course the oxygen are there oxygen of course the oxygen are there any ingredients that we're missing come any ingredients that we're missing come any ingredients that we're missing come dog so it's carbon dioxide carbon dog so it's carbon dioxide carbon dog so it's carbon dioxide carbon dioxide so would it surprise you to find dioxide so would it surprise you to find dioxide so would it surprise you to find out that 95 percent of a tree is out that 95 percent of a tree is out that 95 percent of a tree is actually coming from carbon dioxide actually coming from carbon dioxide actually coming from carbon dioxide trees and largely made up of air so as trees and largely made up of air so as trees and largely made up of air so as it turns out trees are mostly made out it turns out trees are mostly made out it turns out trees are mostly made out of air out of the carbon dioxide that of air out of the carbon dioxide that of air out of the carbon dioxide that they take in and what's interesting is they take in and what's interesting is they take in and what's interesting is that we breathe out carbon dioxide and that we breathe out carbon dioxide and that we breathe out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's water that's how we lose mass but it's water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances that trees the exact same substances that trees the exact same substances that trees breathe in to gain mass so if you can breathe in to gain mass so if you can breathe in to gain mass so if you can imagine a closed system where it was imagine a closed system where it was imagine a closed system where it was just you and a tree you would breathe just you and a tree you would breathe just you and a tree you would breathe out that carbon dioxide and water the out that carbon dioxide and water the out that carbon dioxide and water the tree would take it in so you would get tree would take it in so you would get tree would take it in so you would get smaller while the tree is getting bigger smaller while the tree is getting bigger smaller while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree
