WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en So obviously there are tons and tons of So obviously there are tons and tons of So obviously there are tons and tons of protons in the sun. The question is if protons in the sun. The question is if protons in the sun. The question is if the sun were totally made of protons, the sun were totally made of protons, the sun were totally made of protons, how many would there be? Well, we can how many would there be? Well, we can how many would there be? Well, we can work that out by taking the total mass work that out by taking the total mass work that out by taking the total mass of the sun 2 * 10 30 kg of the sun 2 * 10 30 kg of the sun 2 * 10 30 kg and dividing by the mass of 1 proton, and dividing by the mass of 1 proton, and dividing by the mass of 1 proton, which is 1.673 673 which is 1.673 673 which is 1.673 673 * 10 - 27 * 10 - 27 * 10 - 27 kg. kg. kg. And the answer you'll find is 1.1 And the answer you'll find is 1.1 And the answer you'll find is 1.1 95* 95* 95* 10 ^ of 57 10 ^ of 57 10 ^ of 57 protons. protons. protons. If the sun were totally made of protons, If the sun were totally made of protons, If the sun were totally made of protons, that is how many would be there. That's that is how many would be there. That's that is how many would be there. That's really an unthinkable number. It's really an unthinkable number. It's really an unthinkable number. It's basically a one followed by 57 zeros. basically a one followed by 57 zeros. basically a one followed by 57 zeros. A huge number of protons. Now, if you A huge number of protons. Now, if you A huge number of protons. Now, if you don't have a calculator handy, you can don't have a calculator handy, you can don't have a calculator handy, you can actually solve this kind of problem by actually solve this kind of problem by actually solve this kind of problem by typing it straight into the Google typing it straight into the Google typing it straight into the Google search field. What you need to do is put search field. What you need to do is put search field. What you need to do is put in 2 e 30. Now, Google interprets this e in 2 e 30. Now, Google interprets this e in 2 e 30. Now, Google interprets this e as time. as time. as time. then divide by 1.673 e minus e minus e minus - 27. - 27. - 27. So if you type that straight into the uh So if you type that straight into the uh So if you type that straight into the uh Google search field, you will find it'll Google search field, you will find it'll Google search field, you will find it'll give you the answer 1.195 give you the answer 1.195 give you the answer 1.195 * 10 ^ of 57.
