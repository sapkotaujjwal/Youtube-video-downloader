NASA will attempt to land a pacific time NASA will attempt to land a spacecraft called insight on Mars while spacecraft called insight on Mars while spacecraft called insight on Mars while a lot of previous missions have looked a lot of previous missions have looked a lot of previous missions have looked for life evidence of past life water for life evidence of past life water for life evidence of past life water liquid water and so on this is the first liquid water and so on this is the first liquid water and so on this is the first mission dedicated to studying the mission dedicated to studying the mission dedicated to studying the interior of Mars insight will do that interior of Mars insight will do that interior of Mars insight will do that from one location there is no Rover so from one location there is no Rover so from one location there is no Rover so wherever it touches down is where the wherever it touches down is where the wherever it touches down is where the science will happen now insight stands science will happen now insight stands science will happen now insight stands for interior exploration using seismic for interior exploration using seismic for interior exploration using seismic investigations geodesy and heat investigations geodesy and heat investigations geodesy and heat transport so let's go through each of transport so let's go through each of transport so let's go through each of these aspects of the mission and discuss these aspects of the mission and discuss these aspects of the mission and discuss the many firsts that will be attempted the many firsts that will be attempted the many firsts that will be attempted in sight is the first Mars mission to in sight is the first Mars mission to in sight is the first Mars mission to use a robotic arm to grasp and place use a robotic arm to grasp and place use a robotic arm to grasp and place instruments directly on the surface of instruments directly on the surface of instruments directly on the surface of Mars sure some Rovers in the past have Mars sure some Rovers in the past have Mars sure some Rovers in the past have rolled off their base and onto Martian rolled off their base and onto Martian rolled off their base and onto Martian soil but this is the first time we're soil but this is the first time we're soil but this is the first time we're essentially playing the claw game on the essentially playing the claw game on the essentially playing the claw game on the surface of another planet without surface of another planet without surface of another planet without real-time feedback of course because of real-time feedback of course because of real-time feedback of course because of the long time delays now one of the the long time delays now one of the the long time delays now one of the instruments that will be placed on the instruments that will be placed on the instruments that will be placed on the surface will be the first seismometer surface will be the first seismometer surface will be the first seismometer actually on Martian soil the Viking actually on Martian soil the Viking actually on Martian soil the Viking landers from the 1970s had seismometers landers from the 1970s had seismometers landers from the 1970s had seismometers on board but because they weren't placed on board but because they weren't placed on board but because they weren't placed directly on the surface of Mars they directly on the surface of Mars they directly on the surface of Mars they essentially just measured the wind essentially just measured the wind essentially just measured the wind blowing over the lander the seismometer blowing over the lander the seismometer blowing over the lander the seismometer will detect earthquakes or actually Mars will detect earthquakes or actually Mars will detect earthquakes or actually Mars quakes and landslides and meteorite quakes and landslides and meteorite quakes and landslides and meteorite impacts now do we expect there to be impacts now do we expect there to be impacts now do we expect there to be many Mars quakes what we really don't many Mars quakes what we really don't many Mars quakes what we really don't know otherwise what would be the point know otherwise what would be the point know otherwise what would be the point of the experiment this is directly of the experiment this is directly of the experiment this is directly relevant to future human exploration of relevant to future human exploration of relevant to future human exploration of Mars because the frequency and intensity Mars because the frequency and intensity Mars because the frequency and intensity of Mars quakes will determine how we of Mars quakes will determine how we of Mars quakes will determine how we build our structures and habitats but build our structures and habitats but build our structures and habitats but the real goal here will be to use any the real goal here will be to use any the real goal here will be to use any significant ground motion to figure out significant ground motion to figure out significant ground motion to figure out what the interior of Mars is like like what the interior of Mars is like like what the interior of Mars is like like how big is its core is it solid or how big is its core is it solid or how big is its core is it solid or liquid it'll be kind of like trying to liquid it'll be kind of like trying to liquid it'll be kind of like trying to figure out the shape and composition of figure out the shape and composition of figure out the shape and composition of a bell by listening to its ring seismic a bell by listening to its ring seismic a bell by listening to its ring seismic waves travel at different velocities waves travel at different velocities waves travel at different velocities depending on the density composition and depending on the density composition and depending on the density composition and state of the material they're traveling state of the material they're traveling state of the material they're traveling through the seismometer should be able through the seismometer should be able through the seismometer should be able to detect ground motions smaller than to detect ground motions smaller than to detect ground motions smaller than the diameter of a hydrogen atom they're the diameter of a hydrogen atom they're the diameter of a hydrogen atom they're achieving this with three tiny precision achieving this with three tiny precision achieving this with three tiny precision pendulums now I don't know how that's pendulums now I don't know how that's pendulums now I don't know how that's actually possible so I'm just taking actually possible so I'm just taking actually possible so I'm just taking their word for it but with such their word for it but with such their word for it but with such exquisite sense exquisite sense exquisite sense divot II they've designed a custom divot II they've designed a custom divot II they've designed a custom windshield to go over the whole thing windshield to go over the whole thing windshield to go over the whole thing preventing the atmosphere from adding preventing the atmosphere from adding preventing the atmosphere from adding noise to the measurements another noise to the measurements another noise to the measurements another instrument will send radio waves back to instrument will send radio waves back to instrument will send radio waves back to earth and by using the Doppler effect we earth and by using the Doppler effect we earth and by using the Doppler effect we should be able to measure how Mars's should be able to measure how Mars's should be able to measure how Mars's rotation axis is wobbling this will rotation axis is wobbling this will rotation axis is wobbling this will provide more insight into the actual provide more insight into the actual provide more insight into the actual structure of the planet structure of the planet structure of the planet think about how a raw egg spins compared think about how a raw egg spins compared think about how a raw egg spins compared to a hard-boiled one the more wobble we to a hard-boiled one the more wobble we to a hard-boiled one the more wobble we observe the more liquid there is inside observe the more liquid there is inside observe the more liquid there is inside and by combining these observations with and by combining these observations with and by combining these observations with the seismographic data we should be able the seismographic data we should be able the seismographic data we should be able to figure out the size of Mars core what to figure out the size of Mars core what to figure out the size of Mars core what it's made of and whether it's liquid or it's made of and whether it's liquid or it's made of and whether it's liquid or solid the thickness and the structure of solid the thickness and the structure of solid the thickness and the structure of the crust and the structure of the the crust and the structure of the the crust and the structure of the mantle and what it's made of another mantle and what it's made of another mantle and what it's made of another first figuring out how much heat is first figuring out how much heat is first figuring out how much heat is escaping Mars interior the first heat escaping Mars interior the first heat escaping Mars interior the first heat probe to be used on Mars will be probe to be used on Mars will be probe to be used on Mars will be deployed on its surface and it will deployed on its surface and it will deployed on its surface and it will burrow nearly five meters down into the burrow nearly five meters down into the burrow nearly five meters down into the planet this is the deepest we have ever planet this is the deepest we have ever planet this is the deepest we have ever dug on any planet besides Earth in fact dug on any planet besides Earth in fact dug on any planet besides Earth in fact it'll take around three months to dig it'll take around three months to dig it'll take around three months to dig that far the probe is attached to a that far the probe is attached to a that far the probe is attached to a tether which has 14 temperature sensors tether which has 14 temperature sensors tether which has 14 temperature sensors along its length to measure the thermal along its length to measure the thermal along its length to measure the thermal gradient beneath the surface and it can gradient beneath the surface and it can gradient beneath the surface and it can only dig into soil if it hits rock we're only dig into soil if it hits rock we're only dig into soil if it hits rock we're in trouble in trouble in trouble this instrument also has heaters on it this instrument also has heaters on it this instrument also has heaters on it so it can warm the ground around it and so it can warm the ground around it and so it can warm the ground around it and see how long it takes for that heat to see how long it takes for that heat to see how long it takes for that heat to reach the other temperature sensors reach the other temperature sensors reach the other temperature sensors finally in sight we'll be the first to finally in sight we'll be the first to finally in sight we'll be the first to use a magnetometer on the surface of use a magnetometer on the surface of use a magnetometer on the surface of Mars Mars long ago lost its global Mars Mars long ago lost its global Mars Mars long ago lost its global magnetic field but there are still magnetic field but there are still magnetic field but there are still magnetic effects to be measured as the magnetic effects to be measured as the magnetic effects to be measured as the solar wind strikes Mars upper atmosphere solar wind strikes Mars upper atmosphere solar wind strikes Mars upper atmosphere it creates moving ions that produce it creates moving ions that produce it creates moving ions that produce magnetic fields and the likely metallic magnetic fields and the likely metallic magnetic fields and the likely metallic core of Mars is proposed to interact core of Mars is proposed to interact core of Mars is proposed to interact with these magnetic fields which would with these magnetic fields which would with these magnetic fields which would be measured on Mars surface so the be measured on Mars surface so the be measured on Mars surface so the magnetometer provides further insight magnetometer provides further insight magnetometer provides further insight into the nature of Mars core so what is into the nature of Mars core so what is into the nature of Mars core so what is the whole point of this mission well the whole point of this mission well the whole point of this mission well this is straight up science the purpose this is straight up science the purpose this is straight up science the purpose is to better understand how rocky is to better understand how rocky is to better understand how rocky planets like our own form and evolve and planets like our own form and evolve and planets like our own form and evolve and Mars offers a unique opportunity to do Mars offers a unique opportunity to do Mars offers a unique opportunity to do this because it formed at the same time this because it formed at the same time this because it formed at the same time as Earth from roughly the same stuff as Earth from roughly the same stuff as Earth from roughly the same stuff plus it's big enough that it probably plus it's big enough that it probably plus it's big enough that it probably underwent the same geochemical changes underwent the same geochemical changes underwent the same geochemical changes as a as a as a but whereas earth evolved into a lush but whereas earth evolved into a lush but whereas earth evolved into a lush Waterworld Mars evolved into a frozen Waterworld Mars evolved into a frozen Waterworld Mars evolved into a frozen desert so why is that I mean beyond the desert so why is that I mean beyond the desert so why is that I mean beyond the obvious size difference and different obvious size difference and different obvious size difference and different distance to the Sun perhaps insight can distance to the Sun perhaps insight can distance to the Sun perhaps insight can help us find out but first it has to help us find out but first it has to help us find out but first it has to land on Mars and since less than half of land on Mars and since less than half of land on Mars and since less than half of missions to Mars have landed missions to Mars have landed missions to Mars have landed successfully that's a big question mark successfully that's a big question mark successfully that's a big question mark and if you want you can tune in and and if you want you can tune in and and if you want you can tune in and watch the landing live that will only watch the landing live that will only watch the landing live that will only know about four minutes after touchdown know about four minutes after touchdown know about four minutes after touchdown if it made it or not I'll put a link to if it made it or not I'll put a link to if it made it or not I'll put a link to that in the description for me I feel that in the description for me I feel that in the description for me I feel like this is a great mission to like this is a great mission to like this is a great mission to understand some fundamental science understand some fundamental science understand some fundamental science about planets and their formation and about planets and their formation and about planets and their formation and unlike other missions that go to Mars unlike other missions that go to Mars unlike other missions that go to Mars and have to claim some sort of profound and have to claim some sort of profound and have to claim some sort of profound life implications this is about life implications this is about life implications this is about fundamental science and how planets work fundamental science and how planets work fundamental science and how planets work which i think is really cool and I'm which i think is really cool and I'm which i think is really cool and I'm looking forward to the results
