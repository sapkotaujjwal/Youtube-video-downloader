WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en so what is gravity a downward so what is gravity a downward so what is gravity a downward Force yeah something that stops you from Force yeah something that stops you from Force yeah something that stops you from flying away well it keeps me on the flying away well it keeps me on the flying away well it keeps me on the earth I it just I don't I don't fly away earth I it just I don't I don't fly away earth I it just I don't I don't fly away it's so this Indescribable thing that it's so this Indescribable thing that it's so this Indescribable thing that kind of keeps us from flying off into kind of keeps us from flying off into kind of keeps us from flying off into space is it what's keeping me on the space is it what's keeping me on the space is it what's keeping me on the ground isn't that ground isn't that ground isn't that gravity gravity is that which keeps us gravity gravity is that which keeps us gravity gravity is that which keeps us constant I presume on this particular constant I presume on this particular constant I presume on this particular glob gravity would be the natural glob gravity would be the natural glob gravity would be the natural tendency for things to move towards tendency for things to move towards tendency for things to move towards massive objects massive objects massive objects like the earth I suppose it would be the like the earth I suppose it would be the like the earth I suppose it would be the largest mass or the most powerful Mass largest mass or the most powerful Mass largest mass or the most powerful Mass which is what the Sun so the sun affects which is what the Sun so the sun affects which is what the Sun so the sun affects all the other planets pulling it around all the other planets pulling it around all the other planets pulling it around what is gravity gravity is the force what is gravity gravity is the force what is gravity gravity is the force that attracts Moon uh to the Earth it that attracts Moon uh to the Earth it that attracts Moon uh to the Earth it actually attracts the smaller uh planets actually attracts the smaller uh planets actually attracts the smaller uh planets to the bigger ones I'm thinking cuz this to the bigger ones I'm thinking cuz this to the bigger ones I'm thinking cuz this is the moon and this is obviously the is the moon and this is obviously the is the moon and this is obviously the king it's affecting it it's pulling it king it's affecting it it's pulling it king it's affecting it it's pulling it cuz the Earth is bigger it has a cuz the Earth is bigger it has a cuz the Earth is bigger it has a gravitational full like the moon has a gravitational full like the moon has a gravitational full like the moon has a gravitational pull towards the earth I gravitational pull towards the earth I gravitational pull towards the earth I know it's applied like it is gathered uh know it's applied like it is gathered uh know it's applied like it is gathered uh depending on the mass of an object uh depending on the mass of an object uh depending on the mass of an object uh that's probably about all I know about that's probably about all I know about that's probably about all I know about gravity uh that and that it's towards gravity uh that and that it's towards gravity uh that and that it's towards the center of an object gravity is GRA the center of an object gravity is GRA the center of an object gravity is GRA the pool of this core of the Earth does the pool of this core of the Earth does the pool of this core of the Earth does gravity exist anywhere else but to the gravity exist anywhere else but to the gravity exist anywhere else but to the core of the earth no it's around the Sun core of the earth no it's around the Sun core of the earth no it's around the Sun keeps us revolving around the Sun type keeps us revolving around the Sun type keeps us revolving around the Sun type of mass has some form of gravitational of mass has some form of gravitational of mass has some form of gravitational pull yeah yeah so do you have a pull yeah yeah so do you have a pull yeah yeah so do you have a gravitational pull I imagine it'd be gravitational pull I imagine it'd be gravitational pull I imagine it'd be very small but yeah probably does the very small but yeah probably does the very small but yeah probably does the Moon have its own gravity yes because it Moon have its own gravity yes because it Moon have its own gravity yes because it has mess do you have has mess do you have has mess do you have gravity yes because I'm awesome it's uh gravity yes because I'm awesome it's uh gravity yes because I'm awesome it's uh bodies with mass that're attracted to bodies with mass that're attracted to bodies with mass that're attracted to each other is that true of all bodies each other is that true of all bodies each other is that true of all bodies with mass um I don't know I I think so with mass um I don't know I I think so with mass um I don't know I I think so so are you attracted to that so are you attracted to that so are you attracted to that tree um I don't know probably like not tree um I don't know probably like not tree um I don't know probably like not very much but maybe a little bit
