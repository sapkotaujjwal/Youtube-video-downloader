WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en Well an atom's made of protons, neutrons, and electrons the first two in the nucleus, the third around it it's mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case The elements are all the different types of atoms they differ by the number of protons in the middle. Hydrogen has only one, but Uranium has a ton It's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms Well atoms bond together to form molecules Most of what's surrounding me and you Water, sugar, things yet undreamed of of of of Look around you, see the combinations in a eucalypt tree Mendeleev's periodicity gives us sand and water and the air above ove ove ove ove It's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms: Hydrogen, Ox-y-gen, Carbon, Nitrogen, make up the world's life forms Do do do you, do do do do but do you wonder how matter forms something strange when there's a chemical change? Where did these atoms come from? They were fused in stars Light elements combine releasing light from afar Fusion in the sun, creates Helium I guess what I be saying is you gotta use your reason To open up your mind and see the cause of the seasons How do we know what's true? The scientific method shows you It's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms Atoms bond together to form molecules Most of what's surrounding me and you Water, sugar, sand and you'll find things undreamed of Argon, Neon, Xenon There's no need to overstate 'Cause we are of course This, of this, of this, we're made: atoms
