WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] okay so we're going for a ride around okay so we're going for a ride around okay so we're going for a ride around the the the pyramids the Great Pyramid was the pyramids the Great Pyramid was the pyramids the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure for nearly tallest man-made structure for nearly tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years only surpassed by a large 4,000 years only surpassed by a large 4,000 years only surpassed by a large margin by the Eiffel Tower in margin by the Eiffel Tower in margin by the Eiffel Tower in 1889 147 M High you are interested by 1889 147 M High you are interested by 1889 147 M High you are interested by climbing yeah it's climbing but he is climbing yeah it's climbing but he is climbing yeah it's climbing but he is not free how much what makes the not free how much what makes the not free how much what makes the pyramids even more impressive is that pyramids even more impressive is that pyramids even more impressive is that these structures were built over 4,500 these structures were built over 4,500 these structures were built over 4,500 years years ago when Egyptians didn't years years ago when Egyptians didn't years years ago when Egyptians didn't have wheels or steel the only metal have wheels or steel the only metal have wheels or steel the only metal available was copper and copper Alloys available was copper and copper Alloys available was copper and copper Alloys it took about 2 million stones to build it took about 2 million stones to build it took about 2 million stones to build that pyramid well I call them Stones that pyramid well I call them Stones that pyramid well I call them Stones giant rocks somewhere between 1 and 1 12 giant rocks somewhere between 1 and 1 12 giant rocks somewhere between 1 and 1 12 and 3 tons each the pyramids took about and 3 tons each the pyramids took about and 3 tons each the pyramids took about 20 to 30 years to make it's a long time 20 to 30 years to make it's a long time 20 to 30 years to make it's a long time but if you think about the number of but if you think about the number of but if you think about the number of stones a couple million stones in every stones a couple million stones in every stones a couple million stones in every pyramid you'd have to be laying a stone pyramid you'd have to be laying a stone pyramid you'd have to be laying a stone roughly once every 3 minutes roughly once every 3 minutes roughly once every 3 minutes if you consider a regular workday like a if you consider a regular workday like a if you consider a regular workday like a 10 hour 12h hour workday nobody know how 10 hour 12h hour workday nobody know how 10 hour 12h hour workday nobody know how they build it it's still secret but a they build it it's still secret but a they build it it's still secret but a lot of people they try to do the best to lot of people they try to do the best to lot of people they try to do the best to give you some information about how they give you some information about how they give you some information about how they did it but we must say it's secret they did it but we must say it's secret they did it but we must say it's secret they did and they take the secret of them did and they take the secret of them did and they take the secret of them nobody know no plans survive to show us nobody know no plans survive to show us nobody know no plans survive to show us how the pyramids were built so perhaps how the pyramids were built so perhaps how the pyramids were built so perhaps it's not surprising that this is the it's not surprising that this is the it's not surprising that this is the subject of countless conspiracy theories subject of countless conspiracy theories subject of countless conspiracy theories involving aliens time travel or lost involving aliens time travel or lost involving aliens time travel or lost Technologies but there is a a less Technologies but there is a a less Technologies but there is a a less far-fetched myth which has become widely far-fetched myth which has become widely far-fetched myth which has become widely accepted that the pyramids were built by accepted that the pyramids were built by accepted that the pyramids were built by slaves but recent discoveries suggest slaves but recent discoveries suggest slaves but recent discoveries suggest the pyramid Builders were not slaves at the pyramid Builders were not slaves at the pyramid Builders were not slaves at all they were skilled workers all they were skilled workers all they were skilled workers well-preserved tombs near the pyramids well-preserved tombs near the pyramids well-preserved tombs near the pyramids suggest that their hard labor and suggest that their hard labor and suggest that their hard labor and sacrifice were rewarded if these workers sacrifice were rewarded if these workers sacrifice were rewarded if these workers had been slaves they would not have had been slaves they would not have had been slaves they would not have received such honorable received such honorable received such honorable burials but how did they actually manage burials but how did they actually manage burials but how did they actually manage to build the pyramids one of the things to build the pyramids one of the things to build the pyramids one of the things I find really interesting is that the I find really interesting is that the I find really interesting is that the Egyptians did didn't know about wheels Egyptians did didn't know about wheels Egyptians did didn't know about wheels so they didn't really even use rollers so they didn't really even use rollers so they didn't really even use rollers as far as we can tell I mean these rocks as far as we can tell I mean these rocks as far as we can tell I mean these rocks would have been carted across the desert would have been carted across the desert would have been carted across the desert on sleds there's a famous diagram of on sleds there's a famous diagram of on sleds there's a famous diagram of this giant statue being pulled by 172 this giant statue being pulled by 172 this giant statue being pulled by 172 men and that that statue would have men and that that statue would have men and that that statue would have weighed somewhere on the order of 68 weighed somewhere on the order of 68 weighed somewhere on the order of 68 tons or something this would normally tons or something this would normally tons or something this would normally create a lot of friction but the sand create a lot of friction but the sand create a lot of friction but the sand was wetted in front of the sled was wetted in front of the sled was wetted in front of the sled experiments show this would reduce the experiments show this would reduce the experiments show this would reduce the pulling Force required by half the pulling Force required by half the pulling Force required by half the internal Stone of this pyramid are all internal Stone of this pyramid are all internal Stone of this pyramid are all Limestone which is a bit softer and Limestone which is a bit softer and Limestone which is a bit softer and easier to work you can imagine them easier to work you can imagine them easier to work you can imagine them working it with those copper chisels working it with those copper chisels working it with those copper chisels that they had some of these blocks may that they had some of these blocks may that they had some of these blocks may have been actually sawed through using have been actually sawed through using have been actually sawed through using copper saws now you wouldn't think that copper saws now you wouldn't think that copper saws now you wouldn't think that copper could really cut rock but if you copper could really cut rock but if you copper could really cut rock but if you put an abrasive in there like a a sand put an abrasive in there like a a sand put an abrasive in there like a a sand you could actually wear away the stone you could actually wear away the stone you could actually wear away the stone probably be a very difficult and labor probably be a very difficult and labor probably be a very difficult and labor intensive job something that you don't intensive job something that you don't intensive job something that you don't really think about is that when you really think about is that when you really think about is that when you build a pyramid you need to build it on build a pyramid you need to build it on build a pyramid you need to build it on level ground you can actually see there level ground you can actually see there level ground you can actually see there how they had to level out that ground how they had to level out that ground how they had to level out that ground well it speculated that when the Nile well it speculated that when the Nile well it speculated that when the Nile flooded they put the flood water into a flooded they put the flood water into a flooded they put the flood water into a channel and see where the high parts channel and see where the high parts channel and see where the high parts were so the inside Was Made of This were so the inside Was Made of This were so the inside Was Made of This Limestone the outside of this pyramid Limestone the outside of this pyramid Limestone the outside of this pyramid was actually made of granite much harder was actually made of granite much harder was actually made of granite much harder Stone I'm at the Granite Quarry in Awan Stone I'm at the Granite Quarry in Awan Stone I'm at the Granite Quarry in Awan where they would have quarried the where they would have quarried the where they would have quarried the stones that were used in the pyramids at stones that were used in the pyramids at stones that were used in the pyramids at Giza now that is an incredible feat Giza now that is an incredible feat Giza now that is an incredible feat because this is nearly 1,000 kilm away because this is nearly 1,000 kilm away because this is nearly 1,000 kilm away from Giza and when the Nile flooded from Giza and when the Nile flooded from Giza and when the Nile flooded water would come right through here so water would come right through here so water would come right through here so that they could move all the stones that they could move all the stones that they could move all the stones quarried here this Granite they could quarried here this Granite they could quarried here this Granite they could move this back up to Giza and use it on move this back up to Giza and use it on move this back up to Giza and use it on the pyramids these would have had to the pyramids these would have had to the pyramids these would have had to been floated down on rafts now quaring been floated down on rafts now quaring been floated down on rafts now quaring this would have been really hard Granite this would have been really hard Granite this would have been really hard Granite is one of the hardest rocks because it is one of the hardest rocks because it is one of the hardest rocks because it contains quartz and quartz on the contains quartz and quartz on the contains quartz and quartz on the hardness scale is about a seven where hardness scale is about a seven where hardness scale is about a seven where diamond is a 10 so how would you dig a diamond is a 10 so how would you dig a diamond is a 10 so how would you dig a massive trench like that basically the massive trench like that basically the massive trench like that basically the technique was just to smash the doite technique was just to smash the doite technique was just to smash the doite rock into the granite over and over over rock into the granite over and over over rock into the granite over and over over and over again they would make about 5 and over again they would make about 5 and over again they would make about 5 mm progress per hour so there is no mm progress per hour so there is no mm progress per hour so there is no clear account of how the pyramids were clear account of how the pyramids were clear account of how the pyramids were actually built but the best guess is actually built but the best guess is actually built but the best guess is that ramps were used and in fact some that ramps were used and in fact some that ramps were used and in fact some ramps have been found on incomplete ramps have been found on incomplete ramps have been found on incomplete pyramids but you can't build just a pyramids but you can't build just a pyramids but you can't build just a straight ramp a long straight ramp and straight ramp a long straight ramp and straight ramp a long straight ramp and keep putting the Rocks up I mean the keep putting the Rocks up I mean the keep putting the Rocks up I mean the problem with that is the the ramp problem with that is the the ramp problem with that is the the ramp actually ends up taking up more material actually ends up taking up more material actually ends up taking up more material than the pyramid itself I think a ramp than the pyramid itself I think a ramp than the pyramid itself I think a ramp which sort of wraps around the pyramids which sort of wraps around the pyramids which sort of wraps around the pyramids is probably the most likely thing the is probably the most likely thing the is probably the most likely thing the top third of the height of the pyramid top third of the height of the pyramid top third of the height of the pyramid actually only accounts for about 4% of actually only accounts for about 4% of actually only accounts for about 4% of all the material in the pyramid that's all the material in the pyramid that's all the material in the pyramid that's why it suspected that levers were why it suspected that levers were why it suspected that levers were actually used to finish off the pyramid actually used to finish off the pyramid actually used to finish off the pyramid to do the top levels now the pyramids to do the top levels now the pyramids to do the top levels now the pyramids have clearly weathered but in the past have clearly weathered but in the past have clearly weathered but in the past they would have been a brighter white they would have been a brighter white they would have been a brighter white because they would have used a white because they would have used a white because they would have used a white Limestone to cover the whole face of Limestone to cover the whole face of Limestone to cover the whole face of that pyramid and then the very top may that pyramid and then the very top may that pyramid and then the very top may have been covered with electrum which is have been covered with electrum which is have been covered with electrum which is a mixture of gold and silver so if you a mixture of gold and silver so if you a mixture of gold and silver so if you can imagine can imagine can imagine that would be a pretty spectacular site that would be a pretty spectacular site that would be a pretty spectacular site the reason these pyramids are are shaped the reason these pyramids are are shaped the reason these pyramids are are shaped this way is so they represent sun rays this way is so they represent sun rays this way is so they represent sun rays imagine what that would have looked like imagine what that would have looked like imagine what that would have looked like when it was first built with a shiny when it was first built with a shiny when it was first built with a shiny metallic top and smooth white finish on metallic top and smooth white finish on metallic top and smooth white finish on on all of those sides I think that would on all of those sides I think that would on all of those sides I think that would have been a sight to have been a sight to have been a sight to [Music] behold hey I hope you enjoyed that video behold hey I hope you enjoyed that video behold hey I hope you enjoyed that video I filmed it earlier this year when I was I filmed it earlier this year when I was I filmed
