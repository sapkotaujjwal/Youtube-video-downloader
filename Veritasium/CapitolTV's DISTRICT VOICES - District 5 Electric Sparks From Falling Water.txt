WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Music] [Music] [Music] this is capital TV greetings citizens welcome to the TV greetings citizens welcome to the TV greetings citizens welcome to the corilanus 99 solar thermal power plant corilanus 99 solar thermal power plant corilanus 99 solar thermal power plant in the heart of District in the heart of District in the heart of District 5 this facility generates over 7% of our 5 this facility generates over 7% of our 5 this facility generates over 7% of our proud capitals energy needs but did you proud capitals energy needs but did you proud capitals energy needs but did you know that you can generate electricity know that you can generate electricity know that you can generate electricity from Mere drops of from Mere drops of from Mere drops of water I'm going to show you an water I'm going to show you an water I'm going to show you an experiment that does just that as we experiment that does just that as we experiment that does just that as we turn on the water it falls through these turn on the water it falls through these turn on the water it falls through these rings and onto this mesh below but look rings and onto this mesh below but look rings and onto this mesh below but look here after a here after a here after a moment there it is it generates a spark moment there it is it generates a spark moment there it is it generates a spark of roughly 20,000 th000 volts of of roughly 20,000 th000 volts of of roughly 20,000 th000 volts of electricity and there is no power source electricity and there is no power source electricity and there is no power source here no turbine as in traditional Hydro here no turbine as in traditional Hydro here no turbine as in traditional Hydro generation in fact there are no moving generation in fact there are no moving generation in fact there are no moving Parts at all we are creating electricity Parts at all we are creating electricity Parts at all we are creating electricity using only the intrinsic properties of using only the intrinsic properties of using only the intrinsic properties of falling water so how does it work well falling water so how does it work well falling water so how does it work well water contains charged particles called water contains charged particles called water contains charged particles called ions it has equal numbers of positive ions it has equal numbers of positive ions it has equal numbers of positive and negative ions so overall it's and negative ions so overall it's and negative ions so overall it's neutral however as the water falls there neutral however as the water falls there neutral however as the water falls there will sometimes be a slight charge will sometimes be a slight charge will sometimes be a slight charge imbalance with a little bit more imbalance with a little bit more imbalance with a little bit more negative charge over here and a bit more negative charge over here and a bit more negative charge over here and a bit more positive charge there under ordinary positive charge there under ordinary positive charge there under ordinary circumstances these variations would circumstances these variations would circumstances these variations would even out over time but not in this case even out over time but not in this case even out over time but not in this case here's the ingenious part the mesh on here's the ingenious part the mesh on here's the ingenious part the mesh on the left is connected to the ring on the the left is connected to the ring on the the left is connected to the ring on the right so if this mesh becomes negatively right so if this mesh becomes negatively right so if this mesh becomes negatively charged then so does this ring and now charged then so does this ring and now charged then so does this ring and now that ring will attract the positively that ring will attract the positively that ring will attract the positively charged ions in theall water so the mesh charged ions in theall water so the mesh charged ions in theall water so the mesh on the right will now be more positively on the right will now be more positively on the right will now be more positively charged meaning so is this charged meaning so is this charged meaning so is this ring so what we have is a clear ring so what we have is a clear ring so what we have is a clear separation of charge there's a separation of charge there's a separation of charge there's a positively charged stream on the right positively charged stream on the right positively charged stream on the right and a negatively charged stream on the and a negatively charged stream on the and a negatively charged stream on the left and the more the charge builds up left and the more the charge builds up left and the more the charge builds up on the meshes the faster that charge on the meshes the faster that charge on the meshes the faster that charge increases and finally when we have increases and finally when we have increases and finally when we have reached our designed operating voltage reached our designed operating voltage reached our designed operating voltage of 20,000 volts electrons jump from the of 20,000 volts electrons jump from the of 20,000 volts electrons jump from the negative rings to the positive ones negative rings to the positive ones negative rings to the positive ones through this spark gap ionizing the air through this spark gap ionizing the air through this spark gap ionizing the air as they do so we have created an as they do so we have created an as they do so we have created an electric generator with little more than electric generator with little more than electric generator with little more than a stream of water droplets no field of a stream of water droplets no field of a stream of water droplets no field of mirrors or enormous coal burning plant mirrors or enormous coal burning plant mirrors or enormous coal burning plant is required in fact with access to the is required in fact with access to the is required in fact with access to the right materials you could even build right materials you could even build right materials you could even build this apparatus at this apparatus at this apparatus at home thank you for your attention we home thank you for your attention we home thank you for your attention we
