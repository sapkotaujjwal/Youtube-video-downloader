been made as often or as prediction has been made as often or as incorrectly as that one in 1922 it was incorrectly as that one in 1922 it was incorrectly as that one in 1922 it was Thomas Edison who declared that the Thomas Edison who declared that the Thomas Edison who declared that the motion picture is destined to motion picture is destined to motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and revolutionize our educational system and revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant that in a few years it will supplant that in a few years it will supplant largely if not entirely the use of largely if not entirely the use of largely if not entirely the use of textbooks yeah and you know how that textbooks yeah and you know how that textbooks yeah and you know how that worked out by the 1930s it was radio the worked out by the 1930s it was radio the worked out by the 1930s it was radio the idea was you could beam experts directly idea was you could beam experts directly idea was you could beam experts directly into classrooms improving the quality of into classrooms improving the quality of into classrooms improving the quality of education for more students at lower education for more students at lower education for more students at lower cost and that would mean you require cost and that would mean you require cost and that would mean you require fewer skilled teachers a theme common to fewer skilled teachers a theme common to fewer skilled teachers a theme common to all of the proposed education all of the proposed education all of the proposed education revolutions like that of educational revolutions like that of educational revolutions like that of educational television in the 1950s and 60s studies television in the 1950s and 60s studies television in the 1950s and 60s studies were conducted to determine whether were conducted to determine whether were conducted to determine whether students preferred watching a lecture students preferred watching a lecture students preferred watching a lecture live or sitting in an adjacent room live or sitting in an adjacent room live or sitting in an adjacent room where the same lecture was broadcast via where the same lecture was broadcast via where the same lecture was broadcast via closed-circuit TV what would you prefer closed-circuit TV what would you prefer closed-circuit TV what would you prefer in the 80s there was no debating in the 80s there was no debating in the 80s there was no debating computers were the revolutionary computers were the revolutionary computers were the revolutionary solution to our educational woes they solution to our educational woes they solution to our educational woes they were audio-visual interactive and could were audio-visual interactive and could were audio-visual interactive and could be programmed to do almost anything you be programmed to do almost anything you be programmed to do almost anything you like like like well at the time they could run Oregon well at the time they could run Oregon well at the time they could run Oregon Trail but their potential was obvious Trail but their potential was obvious Trail but their potential was obvious researchers suspected that if they could researchers suspected that if they could researchers suspected that if they could teach kids to program say how to move a teach kids to program say how to move a teach kids to program say how to move a turtle around a screen then their turtle around a screen then their turtle around a screen then their procedural reasoning skills would also procedural reasoning skills would also procedural reasoning skills would also improve so how did it go well the improve so how did it go well the improve so how did it go well the students got better at programming the students got better at programming the students got better at programming the turtle but their reasoning skills were turtle but their reasoning skills were turtle but their reasoning skills were unaffected even by the 1990s we had not unaffected even by the 1990s we had not unaffected even by the 1990s we had not learned from the failure of our past learned from the failure of our past learned from the failure of our past predictions and I quote the use of video predictions and I quote the use of video predictions and I quote the use of video discs in classroom instruction is discs in classroom instruction is discs in classroom instruction is increasing every year and promises to increasing every year and promises to increasing every year and promises to revolutionize what will happen in the revolutionize what will happen in the revolutionize what will happen in the classroom of tomorrow video discs yeah classroom of tomorrow video discs yeah classroom of tomorrow video discs yeah those giant oversized CD things remember those giant oversized CD things remember those giant oversized CD things remember when they revolutionized education when they revolutionized education when they revolutionized education nowadays plenty of things are poised to nowadays plenty of things are poised to nowadays plenty of things are poised to revolutionize education like smart revolutionize education like smart revolutionize education like smart boards smartphones tablets and MOOCs boards smartphones tablets and MOOCs boards smartphones tablets and MOOCs those are massive open online courses those are massive open online courses those are massive open online courses and some believe we're getting close to and some believe we're getting close to and some believe we're getting close to a universal teaching machine a computer a universal teaching machine a computer a universal teaching machine a computer so quick and well programmed that is so quick and well programmed that is so quick and well programmed that is basically like having your own personal basically like having your own personal basically like having your own personal tutor in tutor in tutor in Sheen a student could work through Sheen a student could work through Sheen a student could work through well-structured lessons at their own well-structured lessons at their own well-structured lessons at their own pace receiving immediate and personally pace receiving immediate and personally pace receiving immediate and personally tailored feedback and all without the tailored feedback and all without the tailored feedback and all without the interference of a meddlesome and interference of a meddlesome and interference of a meddlesome and expensive teacher do these claims sound expensive teacher do these claims sound expensive teacher do these claims sound familiar over the past 100 years a lot familiar over the past 100 years a lot familiar over the past 100 years a lot of areas of life have been of areas of life have been of areas of life have been revolutionized but education is not one revolutionized but education is not one revolutionized but education is not one of them by and large students are still of them by and large students are still of them by and large students are still taught in groups by a single teacher and taught in groups by a single teacher and taught in groups by a single teacher and that is not what a revolution looks like that is not what a revolution looks like that is not what a revolution looks like some might blame this state of affairs some might blame this state of affairs some might blame this state of affairs on the inertia of our educational on the inertia of our educational on the inertia of our educational institutions it's just too hard to get a institutions it's just too hard to get a institutions it's just too hard to get a huge bureaucracy to change but I think huge bureaucracy to change but I think huge bureaucracy to change but I think the reason technology hasn't the reason technology hasn't the reason technology hasn't revolutionized education is something revolutionized education is something revolutionized education is something else something that goes to the very else something that goes to the very else something that goes to the very heart of what education is let's heart of what education is let's heart of what education is let's consider the process of learning say you consider the process of learning say you consider the process of learning say you want to teach someone how a human heart want to teach someone how a human heart want to teach someone how a human heart pumps blood which learning a do you pumps blood which learning a do you pumps blood which learning a do you think would be more effective this think would be more effective this think would be more effective this animation with narration or this set of animation with narration or this set of animation with narration or this set of static pictures with text obviously the static pictures with text obviously the static pictures with text obviously the animation is better I mean for one thing animation is better I mean for one thing animation is better I mean for one thing it shows exactly what the heart does for it shows exactly what the heart does for it shows exactly what the heart does for decades educational research focused on decades educational research focused on decades educational research focused on questions like this does a video promote questions like this does a video promote questions like this does a video promote learning better than a book our live learning better than a book our live learning better than a book our live lectures more effective than televised lectures more effective than televised lectures more effective than televised lectures is animation better than static lectures is animation better than static lectures is animation better than static graphics in all well-controlled studies graphics in all well-controlled studies graphics in all well-controlled studies the result is no significant difference the result is no significant difference the result is no significant difference that is so long as the content is that is so long as the content is that is so long as the content is equivalent between the two treatments equivalent between the two treatments equivalent between the two treatments the learning outcomes are the same with the learning outcomes are the same with the learning outcomes are the same with all different media how is this possible all different media how is this possible all different media how is this possible how can something which seems so how can something which seems so how can something which seems so powerful like animation be no more powerful like animation be no more powerful like animation be no more effective than static graphics well for effective than static graphics well for effective than static graphics well for one thing one thing one thing animations are fleeting and so you might animations are fleeting and so you might animations are fleeting and so you might miss something as they go by Plus since miss something as they go by Plus since miss something as they go by Plus since the parts are animated for you you don't the parts are animated for you you don't the parts are animated for you you don't have to mentally envision how the parts have to mentally envision how the parts have to mentally envision how the parts are moving and so you don't have to are moving and so you don't have to are moving and so you don't have to invest as much mental effort which would invest as much mental effort which would invest as much mental effort which would make it more memorable in fact sometimes make it more memorable in fact sometimes make it more memorable in fact sometimes esthetic graphics perform better than esthetic graphics perform better than esthetic graphics perform better than animations and I think this points to a animations and I think this points to a animations and I think this points to a really fundamental aspect of Education really fundamental aspect of Education really fundamental aspect of Education which is it doesn't matter what happens which is it doesn't matter what happens which is it doesn't matter what happens around the learner we are not limited by around the learner we are not limited by around the learner we are not limited by the experiences we can give to students the experiences we can give to students the experiences we can give to students what limits learning is what can happen what limits learning is what can happen what limits learning is what can happen inside this inside this inside this head that is where the important part of head that is where the important part of head that is where the important part of learning takes place no technology is learning takes place no technology is learning takes place no technology is inherently superior to any other inherently superior to any other inherently superior to any other researchers spent so much time researchers spent so much time researchers spent so much time investigating whether one medium or investigating whether one medium or investigating whether one medium or technology was more effective than technology was more effective than technology was more effective than another that they failed to investigate another that they failed to investigate another that they failed to investigate exactly how to use the technology to exactly how to use the technology to exactly how to use the technology to promote meaningful thought processes so promote meaningful thought processes so promote meaningful thought processes so the question really is what experiences the question really is what experiences the question really is what experiences promote the kind of thinking that is promote the kind of thinking that is promote the kind of thinking that is required for learning recently that required for learning recently that required for learning recently that research is being conducted and we're research is being conducted and we're research is being conducted and we're finding out some pretty important stuff finding out some pretty important stuff finding out some pretty important stuff I mean it may sound obvious but it turns I mean it may sound obvious but it turns I mean it may sound obvious but it turns out learning with words and pictures out learning with words and pictures out learning with words and pictures together whether they're animation &amp; together whether they're animation &amp; together whether they're animation &amp; narration or static pictures and text narration or static pictures and text narration or static pictures and text works better than words alone also we works better than words alone also we works better than words alone also we see that anything which is extraneous see that anything which is extraneous see that anything which is extraneous needs to be eliminated from a lesson for needs to be eliminated from a lesson for needs to be eliminated from a lesson for example on-screen text example on-screen text example on-screen text competes with visuals so learners competes with visuals so learners competes with visuals so learners perform better when it is omitted than perform better when it is omitted than perform better when it is omitted than when it is present now that we know how when it is present now that we know how when it is present now that we know how best to make educational videos and any best to make educational videos and any best to make educational videos and any experience can be simulated in the video experience can be simulated in the video experience can be simulated in the video setting YouTube must be the platform setting YouTube must be the platform setting YouTube must be the platform that will revolutionize education I mean that will revolutionize education I mean that will revolutionize education I mean the number of educational videos on the number of educational videos on the number of educational videos on YouTube is increasing every day so why YouTube is increasing every day so why YouTube is increasing every day so why do we need teachers well if you think do we need teachers well if you think do we need teachers well if you think that the fundamental job of a teacher is that the fundamental job of a teacher is that the fundamental job of a teacher is to transmit information from their head to transmit information from their head to transmit information from their head to their students then you're right they to their students then you're right they to their students then you're right they are obsolete I mean you probably imagine are obsolete I mean you probably imagine are obsolete I mean you probably imagine a classroom where this teacher is a classroom where this teacher is a classroom where this teacher is spewing out facts at a pace which is spewing out facts at a pace which is spewing out facts at a pace which is appropriate for one student to fast for appropriate for one student to fast for appropriate for one student to fast for half and to slow for the rest half and to slow for the rest half and to slow for the rest luckily the fundamental role of a luckily the fundamental role of a luckily the fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information it teacher is not to deliver information it teacher is not to deliver information it is to guide the social process of is to guide the social process of is to guide the social process of learning the job of a teacher is to learning the job of a teacher is to learning the job of a teacher is to inspire to challenge to excite their inspire to challenge to excite their inspire to challenge to excite their students to want to learn yes they also students to want to learn yes they also students to want to learn yes they also do explain and demonstrate and show do explain and demonstrate and show do explain and demonstrate and show things but fundamentally that is beside things but fundamentally that is beside things but fundamentally that is beside the point the most important thing a the point the most important thing a the point the most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel teacher does is make every student feel teacher does is make every student feel like they are important to make them like they are important to make them like they are important to make them feel accountable for doing the work of feel accountable for doing the work of feel accountable for doing the work of learning all of this is not to say learning all of this is not to say learning all of this is not to say technology has had no impact on technology has had no impact on technology has had no impact on education students and teachers work and education students and teachers work and education students and teachers work and communicate via computers and videos are communicate via computers and videos are communicate via computers and videos are used both inside used both inside used both inside and outside of classrooms but all of and outside of classrooms but all of and outside of classrooms but all of this is best characterized as an this is best characterized as an this is best characterized as an evolution not a revolution the evolution not a revolution the evolution not a revolution the foundation of Education is still based foundation of Education is still based foundation of Education is still based on the social interaction between on the social interaction between on the social interaction between teachers and students for as teachers and students for as teachers and students for as transformative as each new technology transformative as each new technology transformative as each new technology seems to be like motion pictures or seems to be like motion pictures or seems to be like motion pictures or computers or smart boards what really computers or smart boards what really computers or smart boards what really matters is what happens inside the matters is what happens inside the matters is what happens inside the learners head and making a learner think learners head and making a learner think learners head and making a learner think seems best achieved in a social seems best achieved in a social seems best achieved in a social environment with other learners and a environment with other learners and a environment with other learners and a caring teacher caring teacher caring teacher [Music] [Music]
