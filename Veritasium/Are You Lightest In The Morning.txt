WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so recently A friend of mine says to me so recently A friend of mine says to me so recently A friend of mine says to me Derek you know you're heaviest at night Derek you know you're heaviest at night Derek you know you're heaviest at night before you go to bed and lightest in the before you go to bed and lightest in the before you go to bed and lightest in the morning when you wake up okay but that morning when you wake up okay but that morning when you wake up okay but that doesn't really seem to make sense of doesn't really seem to make sense of doesn't really seem to make sense of course it does overnight you're not course it does overnight you're not course it does overnight you're not eating anything for like 8 hours but eating anything for like 8 hours but eating anything for like 8 hours but you're still burning calories so of you're still burning calories so of you're still burning calories so of course you'll be lightest in the morning course you'll be lightest in the morning course you'll be lightest in the morning yeah but where's the mass going like how yeah but where's the mass going like how yeah but where's the mass going like how are you actually losing particles you are you actually losing particles you are you actually losing particles you can't argue with me I've weighed myself can't argue with me I've weighed myself can't argue with me I've weighed myself at night and the next morning and I know at night and the next morning and I know at night and the next morning and I know it's true is that after you went to the it's true is that after you went to the it's true is that after you went to the toilet no I told you that has nothing to toilet no I told you that has nothing to toilet no I told you that has nothing to do with it why do you have to disagree do with it why do you have to disagree do with it why do you have to disagree with everything that anyone says you with everything that anyone says you with everything that anyone says you just like arguing it's not that I like just like arguing it's not that I like just like arguing it's not that I like arguing it's just that your statement arguing it's just that your statement arguing it's just that your statement seems implausible I need some kind of seems implausible I need some kind of seems implausible I need some kind of mechanism that would explain how you mechanism that would explain how you mechanism that would explain how you could be heaviest at night and then could be heaviest at night and then could be heaviest at night and then lightest by the morning why don't you lightest by the morning why don't you lightest by the morning why don't you Google Google Google it okay so I Googled it and the results it okay so I Googled it and the results it okay so I Googled it and the results were a little bit disturbing I'll be 3 were a little bit disturbing I'll be 3 were a little bit disturbing I'll be 3 to 5 lbs heavier during the nighttime to 5 lbs heavier during the nighttime to 5 lbs heavier during the nighttime hours and when I wake up the next hours and when I wake up the next hours and when I wake up the next morning I'm back back down 5 lb less I morning I'm back back down 5 lb less I morning I'm back back down 5 lb less I usually wear myself in the morning I'm usually wear myself in the morning I'm usually wear myself in the morning I'm anywhere from 3 to 5 lb lighter odd and anywhere from 3 to 5 lb lighter odd and anywhere from 3 to 5 lb lighter odd and empty body weighs less than a full one empty body weighs less than a full one empty body weighs less than a full one the force of gravity also can weigh a the force of gravity also can weigh a the force of gravity also can weigh a person person person down really down really down really internet this is what we're coming internet this is what we're coming internet this is what we're coming to but these are just people posting on to but these are just people posting on to but these are just people posting on forums maybe people out on the street forums maybe people out on the street forums maybe people out on the street are different so I'm going to go find are different so I'm going to go find are different so I'm going to go find some people in Perth and see what they some people in Perth and see what they some people in Perth and see what they say say say but what time a day do you weigh the but what time a day do you weigh the but what time a day do you weigh the most oh what do you reckon I suppose most oh what do you reckon I suppose most oh what do you reckon I suppose evening time when eating too much night evening time when eating too much night evening time when eating too much night time yeah night time night time night time yeah night time night time night time yeah night time night time night time like just before you go to bed yeah time like just before you go to bed yeah time like just before you go to bed yeah I'd say that as well and you're at your I'd say that as well and you're at your I'd say that as well and you're at your lightest in the morning when you wake up lightest in the morning when you wake up lightest in the morning when you wake up well your lightest when you first get well your lightest when you first get well your lightest when you first get out of bed so obviously if you keep on out of bed so obviously if you keep on out of bed so obviously if you keep on eating and drinking during the day you eating and drinking during the day you eating and drinking during the day you know I can prove it because I'm one of know I can prove it because I'm one of know I can prove it because I'm one of these sort of people that weigh yourself these sort of people that weigh yourself these sort of people that weigh yourself weigh I weigh myself every single weigh I weigh myself every single weigh I weigh myself every single morning of my life and and I'm always morning of my life and and I'm always morning of my life and and I'm always always licensed in the morning when are always licensed in the morning when are always licensed in the morning when are you the lightest first thing when you you the lightest first thing when you you the lightest first thing when you wake up just right when you wake up yeah wake up just right when you wake up yeah wake up just right when you wake up yeah you hop out of bed yeah you are a light you hop out of bed yeah you are a light you hop out of bed yeah you are a light man yeah of course the best way to man yeah of course the best way to man yeah of course the best way to settle this is with an experiment so settle this is with an experiment so settle this is with an experiment so every night before I go to bed I will every night before I go to bed I will every night before I go to bed I will weigh myself and in the morning before I weigh myself and in the morning before I weigh myself and in the morning before I go to the bathroom I will weigh myself go to the bathroom I will weigh myself go to the bathroom I will weigh myself again now in any scientific experiment again now in any scientific experiment again now in any scientific experiment it's pretty important to control your it's pretty important to control your it's pretty important to control your variables so every time I go from my variables so every time I go from my variables so every time I go from my weigh in I'm wearing these exact weigh in I'm wearing these exact weigh in I'm wearing these exact clothes I know pretty snazzy right the clothes I know pretty snazzy right the clothes I know pretty snazzy right the hotel staff here have graciously allowed hotel staff here have graciously allowed hotel staff here have graciously allowed me to use their scale but they told me I me to use their scale but they told me I me to use their scale but they told me I can't take it to my room so I need to do can't take it to my room so I need to do can't take it to my room so I need to do the weigh-ins at the the weigh-ins at the the weigh-ins at the concierge I'm going down for my first concierge I'm going down for my first concierge I'm going down for my first weighin Sunday night we'll see what my weighin Sunday night we'll see what my weighin Sunday night we'll see what my weight is right now at 1:7 a.m. all right so right so right so 72.1 Z 72.1 Z 72.1 Z kilos where does the mass go while kilos where does the mass go while kilos where does the mass go while you're sleeping like how do you lose you're sleeping like how do you lose you're sleeping like how do you lose weight while you're sleeping I think it weight while you're sleeping I think it weight while you're sleeping I think it evaporates she sweats a evaporates she sweats a evaporates she sweats a lot I consider digesting it all so it's lot I consider digesting it all so it's lot I consider digesting it all so it's kind of probably compressed and out but kind of probably compressed and out but kind of probably compressed and out but that's true where does it go burning or that's true where does it go burning or that's true where does it go burning or we burning it using it up we burning it using it up we burning it using it up whatever burning carbohydrates okay so whatever burning carbohydrates okay so whatever burning carbohydrates okay so where does the matter actually go where where does the matter actually go where where does the matter actually go where does the weight actually go it's does the weight actually go it's does the weight actually go it's transferred as energy that your body transferred as energy that your body transferred as energy that your body uses as you want like science stuff like uses as you want like science stuff like uses as you want like science stuff like ATP are you saying that we're converting ATP are you saying that we're converting ATP are you saying that we're converting matter into matter into matter into energy yes that's one way of is that energy yes that's one way of is that energy yes that's one way of is that what's happen rid of it it uses up the what's happen rid of it it uses up the what's happen rid of it it uses up the matter yeah so your you're just matter matter yeah so your you're just matter matter yeah so your you're just matter is disappearing from inside you yeah is disappearing from inside you yeah is disappearing from inside you yeah that that's my question everything you that that's my question everything you that that's my question everything you put into you doesn't all come out the put into you doesn't all come out the put into you doesn't all come out the other end as well so your body uses so other end as well so your body uses so other end as well so your body uses so where does it come out what uses certain where does it come out what uses certain where does it come out what uses certain parts of it to uh sustain you and let parts of it to uh sustain you and let parts of it to uh sustain you and let you you you live all right so it doesn't it doesn't live all right so it doesn't it doesn't live all right so it doesn't it doesn't come out of come out of come out of you not all of it it's uh Monday morning you not all of it it's uh Monday morning you not all of it it's uh Monday morning I've just got up I need to go to the I've just got up I need to go to the I've just got up I need to go to the bathroom so before I do that I'm going bathroom so before I do that I'm going bathroom so before I do that I'm going to go down for my weigh in level three to go down for my weigh in level three to go down for my weigh in level three hello last night I weighed hello last night I weighed hello last night I weighed 72.1 kg let's see what I weigh in the morning morning morning 71.9 say 9 25 kilg I'm not really 71.9 say 9 25 kilg I'm not really 71.9 say 9 25 kilg I'm not really surprised my mass has only Changed by surprised my mass has only Changed by surprised my mass has only Changed by about 150 g it doesn't really surprise about 150 g it doesn't really surprise about 150 g it doesn't really surprise me but um yeah I don't think it's uh me but um yeah I don't think it's uh me but um yeah I don't think it's uh backing up my friend's Theory so we'll backing up my friend's Theory so we'll backing up my friend's Theory so we'll have to do this a few more times to make have to do this a few more times to make have to do this a few more times to make sure that uh these results are sure that uh these results are sure that uh these results are [Music] valid it's a difference of about .25 valid it's a difference of about .25 valid it's a difference of about .25 kilos 250 g 72.0 5 kg that's a loss of kilos 250 g 72.0 5 kg that's a loss of kilos 250 g 72.0 5 kg that's a loss of about 300 about 300 about 300 G so it looks like every night you lose G so it looks like every night you lose G so it looks like every night you lose about 250 about 250 about 250 g which is pretty similar to the amount g which is pretty similar to the amount g which is pretty similar to the amount that I've been losing every day this that I've been losing every day this that I've been losing every day this week so how do you actually lose weight week so how do you actually lose weight week so how do you actually lose weight as you sleep well every night this week as you sleep well every night this week as you sleep well every night this week I seem to lose about 250 gram I think I seem to lose about 250 gram I think I seem to lose about 250 gram I think about 150 gram of that was water loss about 150 gram of that was water loss about 150 gram of that was water loss through sweating and breathing out water through sweating and breathing out water through sweating and breathing out water vapor so where is the other 100 gr going vapor so where is the other 100 gr going vapor so where is the other 100 gr going well every time you breathe in you're well every time you breathe in you're well every time you breathe in you're breathing about 500 mL of air but only breathing about 500 mL of air but only breathing about 500 mL of air but only about a fifth of that is oxygen now 3/4 about a fifth of that is oxygen now 3/4 about a fifth of that is oxygen now 3/4 of that oxygen you'll just breathe out of that oxygen you'll just breathe out of that oxygen you'll just breathe out again but one quar of it gets replaced again but one quar of it gets replaced again but one quar of it gets replaced with carbon with carbon with carbon dioxide now carbon dioxide compared to dioxide now carbon dioxide compared to dioxide now carbon dioxide compared to oxygen has the extra mass of carbon on oxygen has the extra mass of carbon on oxygen has the extra mass of carbon on every molecule and the mass of carbon every molecule and the mass of carbon every molecule and the mass of carbon released in every breath is about a released in every breath is about a released in every breath is about a 100th of a gram I know that doesn't 100th of a gram I know that doesn't 100th of a gram I know that doesn't sound like a lot but if you add it up 16 sound like a lot but if you add it up 16 sound like a lot but if you add it up 16 breaths a minute over 8 hours it adds up breaths a minute over 8 hours it adds up breaths a minute over 8 hours it adds up to about 100 G every time you breathe to about 100 G every time you breathe to about 100 G every time you breathe out you're losing weight out you're losing weight out you're losing weight because no come I've never heard of that because no come I've never heard of that because no come I've never heard of that before then I don't know me people don't before then I don't know me people don't before then I don't know me people don't talk about it people don't think about talk about it people don't think about talk about it people don't think about it cuz I I think a lot of people think it cuz I I think a lot of people think it cuz I I think a lot of people think that matter can be converted to energy that matter can be converted to energy that matter can be converted to energy that you can take stuff and then it goes that you can take stuff and then it goes that you can take stuff and then it goes away somehow in the metabolic process in away somehow in the metabolic process in away somehow in the metabolic process in that energy process my point is the that energy process my point is the that energy process my point is the atoms are still there the matter is atoms are still there the matter is atoms are still there the matter is still there you need to get rid of it still there you need to get rid of it still there you need to get rid of it somehow and some of it is is breathed out so people were right when they said out so people were right when they said out so people were right when they said that you are burning calories and that's that you are burning calories and that's that you are burning calories and that's causing you to become lighter they just causing you to become lighter they just causing you to become lighter they just didn't think about the exhaust the water didn't think about the exhaust the water didn't think about the exhaust the water vapor and the carbon dioxide that you vapor and the carbon dioxide that you vapor and the carbon dioxide that you breathe out so it may be the case that breathe out so it may be the case that breathe out so it may be the case that you're heaviest at night and lightest in you're heaviest at night and lightest in you're heaviest at night and lightest in the morning but I think the real truth the morning but I think the real truth the morning but I think the real truth of the matter is your heaviest after of the matter is your heaviest after of the matter is your heaviest after your biggest meal and lightest after your biggest meal and lightest after your biggest meal and lightest after after you've gone to the after you've gone to the after you've gone to the bathroom it's after lunch on Thursday so bathroom it's after lunch on Thursday so bathroom it's after lunch on Thursday so let's see what difference a big meal makes I was makes I was makes I was 71.1 kg I'm now 71.1 kg I'm now 71.1 kg I'm now 72.5 5 nearly added a kilo and a half my 72.5 5 nearly added a kilo and a half my 72.5 5 nearly added a kilo and a half my lunch was nearly a kilo and a half so lunch was nearly a kilo and a half so lunch was nearly a kilo and a half so this morning when I woke up I was 72.1 this morning when I woke up I was 72.1 this morning when I woke up I was 72.1 kg but now I've gone to the bathroom so kg but now I've gone to the bathroom so kg but now I've gone to the bathroom so I'd like to see what difference that I'd like to see what difference that I'd like to see what difference that makes 70.6 70.6 70.6 kg that is a lot of mass that I've lost kg that is a lot of mass that I've lost kg that is a lot of mass that I've lost what is that what is that what is that like 1.5 kilos 1.5 kilos that's a lot of mass
