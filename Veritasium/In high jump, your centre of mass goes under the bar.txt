high jumpers can clear more world's best high jumpers can clear more world's best high jumpers can clear more than half a meter above than half a meter above than half a meter above [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that this is Josh Lodge an Australian that this is Josh Lodge an Australian that this is Josh Lodge an Australian high jumper what's your personal best high jumper what's your personal best high jumper what's your personal best high jump 2 minutes high jump 2 minutes high jump 2 minutes 22 that's pretty high the record is uh s 22 that's pretty high the record is uh s 22 that's pretty high the record is uh s myor from Cuba it's myor from Cuba it's myor from Cuba it's about this High 8T and a half an inch about this High 8T and a half an inch about this High 8T and a half an inch 245 uh same height as a full full men's 245 uh same height as a full full men's 245 uh same height as a full full men's volleyball net can you tell me about volleyball net can you tell me about volleyball net can you tell me about what it's like to be a Hy it's just what it's like to be a Hy it's just what it's like to be a Hy it's just really fun like everyone who sees it I really fun like everyone who sees it I really fun like everyone who sees it I know always wants to do it right yeah know always wants to do it right yeah know always wants to do it right yeah [Music] exactly so can you teach me to jump as exactly so can you teach me to jump as exactly so can you teach me to jump as high as high as high as you you you uh I don't know he knows that he can't uh I don't know he knows that he can't uh I don't know he knows that he can't tell me about the technique that all the tell me about the technique that all the tell me about the technique that all the modern High jumpers use so they do the modern High jumpers use so they do the modern High jumpers use so they do the fby flop so that's with the J curved run fby flop so that's with the J curved run fby flop so that's with the J curved run up generally you have a a straightish up generally you have a a straightish up generally you have a a straightish sort of part and then the last part of sort of part and then the last part of sort of part and then the last part of the run up is curved it's half straight the run up is curved it's half straight the run up is curved it's half straight half half curved yeah so that you can half half curved yeah so that you can half half curved yeah so that you can have more speed and it puts you in the have more speed and it puts you in the have more speed and it puts you in the right position to then get the rotation right position to then get the rotation right position to then get the rotation and and go over on your back and what and and go over on your back and what and and go over on your back and what foot do you take off on uh you take off foot do you take off on uh you take off foot do you take off on uh you take off on your left on your left on your left foot yeah yeah that's right so if you foot yeah yeah that's right so if you foot yeah yeah that's right so if you can only really think about one thing can only really think about one thing can only really think about one thing drive up that Lake I tell people to drive up that Lake I tell people to drive up that Lake I tell people to drive up that drive up that drive up that [Music] [Music] [Music] lake so what did I do wrong there well lake so what did I do wrong there well lake so what did I do wrong there well how much time do we have you started on the wrong foot come have you started on the wrong foot come have you started on the wrong foot come on you can get this so before The Fosbury Flop the main this so before The Fosbury Flop the main this so before The Fosbury Flop the main technique that people used was the technique that people used was the technique that people used was the straddle yeah the straddle or I think it straddle yeah the straddle or I think it straddle yeah the straddle or I think it was also known as the western roll with was also known as the western roll with was also known as the western roll with that technique athletes came on a much that technique athletes came on a much that technique athletes came on a much sharper angle to the bar in a straight sharper angle to the bar in a straight sharper angle to the bar in a straight line and they took off from their leg line and they took off from their leg line and they took off from their leg closest to the bar and um did they go up closest to the bar and um did they go up closest to the bar and um did they go up frontwards or also back they went they frontwards or also back they went they frontwards or also back they went they went over the bar on on their front they went over the bar on on their front they went over the bar on on their front they still required some sort of mats for the still required some sort of mats for the still required some sort of mats for the straddle but I'll show you a scissor uh straddle but I'll show you a scissor uh straddle but I'll show you a scissor uh that was another one that was from the that was another one that was from the that was another one that was from the days when you had to land on your feet days when you had to land on your feet days when you had to land on your feet the days of Saw dust so I think that was the days of Saw dust so I think that was the days of Saw dust so I think that was more like before the 50s pretty much the more like before the 50s pretty much the more like before the 50s pretty much the same as a takeoff to fby flop and then same as a takeoff to fby flop and then same as a takeoff to fby flop and then you just land on your feet yeah you land you just land on your feet yeah you land you just land on your feet yeah you land on your [Music] [Music] [Music] feet that's a really old one and it's feet that's a really old one and it's feet that's a really old one and it's what they did when they didn't have any what they did when they didn't have any what they did when they didn't have any mats so really adding the mat really mats so really adding the mat really mats so really adding the mat really changed the way people jumped yeah yeah changed the way people jumped yeah yeah changed the way people jumped yeah yeah and obviously without having to worry and obviously without having to worry and obviously without having to worry about Landing safely they could they about Landing safely they could they about Landing safely they could they could jump higher regarding the the could jump higher regarding the the could jump higher regarding the the physics of it why is The Fosbury Flop physics of it why is The Fosbury Flop physics of it why is The Fosbury Flop the superior technique technique technique well i' I've heard that it it allows well i' I've heard that it it allows well i' I've heard that it it allows your center of Mass to actually pass your center of Mass to actually pass your center of Mass to actually pass underneath the bar your entire body underneath the bar your entire body underneath the bar your entire body clears the bar but not all at once so clears the bar but not all at once so clears the bar but not all at once so you you're keeping like your legs and you you're keeping like your legs and you you're keeping like your legs and your arms sort of underneath the bar if your arms sort of underneath the bar if your arms sort of underneath the bar if you average where your center of mass is you average where your center of mass is you average where your center of mass is it it's under the bar whereas like the it it's under the bar whereas like the it it's under the bar whereas like the other techniques they seem to you know other techniques they seem to you know other techniques they seem to you know you have to have your whole Center Mass you have to have your whole Center Mass you have to have your whole Center Mass clearing the bar so technically it's clearing the bar so technically it's clearing the bar so technically it's it's harder like you you're getting your it's harder like you you're getting your it's harder like you you're getting your mass up high in order to clear the bar mass up high in order to clear the bar mass up high in order to clear the bar yeah that would make sense because with yeah that would make sense because with yeah that would make sense because with the straddle technique when you go over the straddle technique when you go over the straddle technique when you go over you've got half your body going over the you've got half your body going over the you've got half your body going over the bar all at once yeah whereas in the Flop bar all at once yeah whereas in the Flop bar all at once yeah whereas in the Flop my coach used to talk about it uh like a my coach used to talk about it uh like a my coach used to talk about it uh like a hose so the water coming out of a hose hose so the water coming out of a hose hose so the water coming out of a hose you you only need to get each bit above you you only need to get each bit above you you only need to get each bit above the bar at the right time as opposed to the bar at the right time as opposed to the bar at the right time as opposed to all of it at [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] once once once [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music]
