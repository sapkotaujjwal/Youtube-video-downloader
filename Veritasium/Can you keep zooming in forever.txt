WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en This is a tiny piece of metal&nbsp; just three millimeters across. And here's what happens if&nbsp; you just keep zooming in: 1,000 times, 100,000 times, 50 million times. Each of these blobs is an actual atom. I saw this the other day at&nbsp; the University of Sydney, and it kind of blew my mind&nbsp; because up until just 30 years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; directly seeing atoms like this&nbsp; was thought to be impossible. The rooms that you're going to see here are&nbsp; perhaps the most shielded rooms on campus, or even in the whole of Sydney, I would say. And perhaps also the most expensive. That's wild. So why is it so hard to see atoms? Well, you can't actually see&nbsp; atoms with visible light. That's because while light has wavelengths&nbsp; between 380 and 750 nanometers, an atom is still over 3000 times&nbsp; smaller, just 0.1 nanometers. And if the wavelength of light is much&nbsp; bigger than the thing you're trying to see, the light will just diffract or bend&nbsp; around it so you won't be able to see it. So if you want to see atoms, you need&nbsp; something with a much, much smaller wavelength. The best candidate isn't even light. It's electrons. In 1924, a French physicist named Louis de Broglie&nbsp; worked out that everything was sort of wavelike. Not just light, but matter too. Atoms, molecules, even you&nbsp; yourself have a wavelength. And the formula for this&nbsp; wavelength is Planck's constant,&nbsp;&nbsp; divided by the object's momentum,&nbsp; that is, mass times velocity. So here what you actually see,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's the column of the microscope where&nbsp; we accelerate the 300 kV electrons down. 300 kilovolts, these electrons? So they are relativistic particles. How fast are they moving?&nbsp; 99% of the speed of light? Around 80. 80% the speed of light? Yeah. So what would be their wavelength? The wavelength is the Planck&nbsp; constant over the momentum, right? So if we calculate that, we come to&nbsp; around between 2 to 3 picometers. Whoa! That's over 100,000 times&nbsp; smaller than visible light. So theoretically, you get&nbsp; 100,000 times more resolution. Shortly after de Broglie's discovery, a&nbsp; group of scientists in Germany started&nbsp;&nbsp; working on a microscope that would&nbsp; use these high-speed electrons. The only problem is you can't&nbsp; bend electrons using glass lenses. So how do you focus them? Hans Busch, a German physicist, suggested that&nbsp; an electromagnetic lens might do the trick. He published his results in 1926,&nbsp; but never actually built one. Fortunately, a copy of his paper fell into the&nbsp; hands of an eager young PhD student, Ernst Ruska. Ruska built his first prototype by coiling up&nbsp;&nbsp; some wire and surrounding it with iron —&nbsp; taking care to leave a gap in the middle. Then, when he passed a current through the coil,&nbsp;&nbsp; it induced a donut-shaped magnetic field&nbsp; through the metal and across this gap. This was his lens. To test it, Ruska first boiled&nbsp; electrons off a tungsten filament,&nbsp;&nbsp; the same kind of filament you'd&nbsp; find in an incandescent light bulb. He accelerated these free electrons through a&nbsp;&nbsp; positively charged anode down&nbsp; to his electromagnetic lens. As an electron approaches the lens, the&nbsp; magnetic field exerts a force on it. So if an electron is traveling in the y direction&nbsp; and the magnetic fields are in the x direction, this force, called the Lorentz&nbsp; force, pushes it in the z direction. But as the electron moves this way, it encounters&nbsp; other magnetic field lines along the donut shape, which constantly point its motion in a circle. But then this circular motion means&nbsp; the Lorentz force starts pushing the&nbsp;&nbsp; electron inwards as well, spiraling&nbsp; it into the center of the lens. Now, if you trace the path of&nbsp; the whole beam of electrons,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll see they all get steered&nbsp; into the center, focusing the beam. By 1931, Ruska and his colleague, Max Knoll, used this kind of design&nbsp;&nbsp; to build the first working electron microscope. It was pretty basic, made of brass&nbsp; roughly bolted together, but it worked. The image itself was created once the focused&nbsp;&nbsp; electron beam hit a sample&nbsp; sitting at the focal point. The sample needed to be incredibly&nbsp; thin, only around 100 nanometers thick. More electrons would make it through&nbsp; the thinner parts of the sample than&nbsp;&nbsp; the thicker parts, creating an&nbsp; electron imprint of the sample. Then a second electromagnetic lens magnified this&nbsp;&nbsp; imprint down onto a fluorescent&nbsp; detector, producing the final image. This was known as a transmission&nbsp; electron microscope or TEM. Now, early versions of the&nbsp; microscope barely magnified at all. In fact, it wasn't even better&nbsp; than an optical microscope. But Ruska was determined. Over the next few years, he experimented with&nbsp;&nbsp; adding more lenses onto the microscope&nbsp; to create bigger and bigger images. By the mid-1930s, Ruska had gotten the&nbsp; TEM way past 10,000 times magnification. It could produce close-ups of insects, bacteria,&nbsp;&nbsp; and even viruses at a level far&nbsp; surpassing the optical microscope. But right as Ruska's TEM was taking&nbsp; off, a German physicist named Otto Scherzer&nbsp;&nbsp; published a paper claiming that the&nbsp; microscope was about to hit a brick wall. There was a flaw in the electromagnetic lens,&nbsp; he wrote, that was completely unavoidable. For an electron to make it&nbsp; to the focus of the lens,&nbsp;&nbsp; it needs to be deflected by a specific amount. If you simplify its trajectory, you can define&nbsp; that ideal deflection with this angle theta. This angle depends on the horizontal distance&nbsp;&nbsp; of the electron from the optical&nbsp; axis, and how far down the axis the focus is, also known as the focal&nbsp; length. The shorter the focal length, the stronger the magnification. If you graph this angle as a function&nbsp; of distance to the optical axis,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll see that it can be approximated as linear. The problem is that the magnetic&nbsp; field doesn't scale linearly. It's much stronger near the edges of the magnet. So if you plot the curve for the&nbsp; actual deflection of the electrons,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll see that the magnetic field&nbsp; overdeflects the electrons further out. Their angles are bigger than they should be,&nbsp;&nbsp; so they end up focusing&nbsp; before the rays in the middle. And as a result, the focus is spread across the&nbsp;&nbsp; optical axis instead of being&nbsp; contained in a single point. The blur starts out around the edges of the image,&nbsp; but it gets worse the higher the magnification. This is called spherical aberration, and it&nbsp; distorts every radially symmetric magnetic lens. In fact, it doesn't just affect magnetic lenses. Every spherical lens, from a camera to a telescope&nbsp; to a magnifying glass also suffers from it. But there is a surprisingly simple way to&nbsp; minimize spherical aberration. Just add&nbsp;&nbsp; a second lens, one that diverges&nbsp; light instead of converging it. Now, a diverging lens also&nbsp; suffers from spherical aberration. But if it has the same amount of aberration&nbsp; as your converging lens just in reverse, you can stack the two to essentially&nbsp; cancel out their effects. And that removes the aberrations almost entirely. Almost all modern lens systems in cameras&nbsp;&nbsp; and microscopes use some sort&nbsp; of correcting divergent lens. So you might imagine that the TEM&nbsp; simply needs its own version of a&nbsp;&nbsp; diverging spherical lens to magnify further. But with magnets, this is physically impossible. Every magnet has two poles, a North and a&nbsp; South. It's impossible to just have one. Even if you split a magnet down the middle,&nbsp;&nbsp; it creates two smaller magnets,&nbsp; both with a North and South. And all magnetic field lines have to start at one&nbsp; pole and end at the other, forming a closed loop. It's a direct result of the second&nbsp; Maxwell equation because the field&nbsp;&nbsp; that you create has field lines that&nbsp; start and end at the same magnet. So the electrons will always&nbsp; cross through two lines. The first time it passes through, by the Lorentz&nbsp; force, it's brought into the spiraling motion. And then the second time&nbsp; from that spiraling motion,&nbsp;&nbsp; which has then a slightly different&nbsp; direction, it's pushed towards the axis. That's why all electromagnetic lenses by default&nbsp; will converge that beam, and never diverge it. Even if you shot electrons in from the other&nbsp; side of the lens, they would still get focused. This is what Otto Scherzer's paper proved&nbsp; in 1936, stopping progress on the TEM. It is impossible to produce a radially&nbsp; symmetric magnetic lens that diverges. And this was, of course, a big roadblock&nbsp; for the development of electron microscopy, because people saw, okay, we can&nbsp; accelerate electrons as much as we want, the presence of spherical aberration&nbsp; will always be in the way. Because of this roadblock, advancements in the&nbsp; microscope's resolution slowed significantly. By 1955, another microscope&nbsp; beat the TEM to the punch and&nbsp;&nbsp; took the first generally accepted image of atoms. This was called the field ion microscope,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it worked by shooting helium or neon&nbsp; atoms at an atomically sharp needle tip. The tip was positively charged. So&nbsp; when the gas atoms hit the needle,&nbsp;&nbsp; they got ionized and were ejected&nbsp; off perpendicular to the surface. And that could form an impression&nbsp; of the atomic structure of the tip. But this method was limited. You could only get a sense of the atomic&nbsp; structure of the very tip of the needle. And the images weren't all that impressive. Luckily, Ruska's electron microscope&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't stay stuck in the realm&nbsp; of insects and bacteria forever. Now, you might not be an insect getting&nbsp; bombarded with relativistic electrons, but it can sometimes feel&nbsp; like it when you're getting&nbsp;&nbsp; bombarded with spam calls and targeted ads. It's a real problem when we're&nbsp; researching for our videos. I was reading up on lenses and optics,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a few days later I started getting&nbsp; targeted ads for glasses and eye surgery.

And now back to the electron microscope. Despite Scherzer's aberration limit&nbsp; work on the transmission electron microscope continued. During the next four decades. People tried boosting the resolution with&nbsp; clever workarounds, and perhaps none more&nbsp;&nbsp; so than British-American physicist Albert Crewe. His idea was to replace the tungsten filament,&nbsp;&nbsp; which fired off electrons at&nbsp; random, with a more directed source. So instead of boiling electrons off the surface,&nbsp;&nbsp; he tried pulling them off with&nbsp; a stronger electric field. And, by sharpening the tungsten into a fine tip,&nbsp;&nbsp; he was able to create a narrow beam which was&nbsp; over a thousand times brighter than before. He paired his new narrow beam&nbsp; with an unlikely technology. The cathode ray tube TV. These TVs worked by scanning an&nbsp; electron beam across a screen. The&nbsp;&nbsp; screen was coated in a phosphor that&nbsp; produced light when hit by electrons. And by varying the intensity of the electron beam,&nbsp;&nbsp; you could vary the brightness of the&nbsp; screen, giving you a black-and-white image. Crewe was inspired to design a&nbsp; similar electron beam for the&nbsp;TEM that would scan across the nanoscopic sample. So instead of creating an imprint&nbsp; of the whole sample at once, Crewe's&nbsp;electron beam made smaller imprints,&nbsp; mapping the sample out bit by bit. This wasn't the first time someone had&nbsp; tried to make a scanning version of the&nbsp;TEM. German researcher Manfred von Ardenne&nbsp; built an early prototype in the 1930s,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was destroyed during WWII. When Crewe revived Ardenne's design,&nbsp; he made several drastic improvements,&nbsp;&nbsp; and by 1970 he had this. The first image of single atoms&nbsp; taken with the electron microscope. Researchers quickly jumped to employ his&nbsp; tech, producing countless images of atoms. After nearly a century of improvements&nbsp; from Ruska, Crewe, and many others,&nbsp;&nbsp; the magnification upgrades on&nbsp; the TEM had reached their peak. But Scherzer's problem persisted. Spherical aberration set a hard&nbsp; limit on how small you could see. Even Crewe himself gave up on trying to&nbsp; get around it after over ten years of work. "Unfortunately, we could never make it&nbsp; work. After many heartbreaking attempts,&nbsp;&nbsp; we were forced to admit defeat." Around this time, other microscopes&nbsp; emerged that could also image atoms. These probe microscopes work by gliding an&nbsp; incredibly small stylus across the sample. The stylus detects variations in quantum effects&nbsp;&nbsp; or nanoscale forces to then map the&nbsp; surface structure of the sample. These were easier to build, and&nbsp; because they didn't use any lenses,&nbsp;&nbsp; they weren't limited by spherical aberration. Their images were even 3D. But the looming issue was that&nbsp; these probes weren't really&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing atoms. It was more like feeling atoms. Throughout the 80s and 90s, this was all we had. But what if there was another way? Scherzer's theorem proof that a diverging,&nbsp; radially symmetric lens isn't possible. But if you're willing to give up on that&nbsp; symmetry, well, the theorem no longer applies. The problem is that radial symmetry is&nbsp; arguably the most important property of&nbsp;&nbsp; any lens, because if you break the&nbsp; symmetry, you also break the image. But three maverick scientists&nbsp; thought there might be a way. Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose were known&nbsp;&nbsp; in the electron microscope&nbsp; community as troublemakers, and for years barely anyone had been&nbsp; interested in their research or,&nbsp;&nbsp; more importantly, in funding it. And for a good reason too.&nbsp; Their idea was kind of crazy. I mean, they purposely wanted to break the&nbsp; image using a lens that wasn't symmetric. Their hope was that there would be a small part&nbsp;&nbsp; of this distorted image that&nbsp; would be slightly diverging. And maybe, just maybe, this&nbsp; small part could correct the&nbsp;&nbsp; spherical aberration of the original lens. So they got to work To distort the image, they used a massive nest&nbsp; of electromagnets with six,&nbsp;&nbsp; eight, or even ten separate coils and&nbsp; magnets with bumpy magnetic fields. These were known as the hexapole,&nbsp; octopole, and decapole magnets. So as the electron beam passed through a hexapole,&nbsp;&nbsp; it would twist and squeeze the flat&nbsp; 2D image into a triangular saddle. And the circumference of the original beam&nbsp; would be pushed into the three corners,&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest of the interior stretched out. But now the middle of the image&nbsp; would have a slight concave bow,&nbsp;&nbsp; giving the effect of a small divergence. Then Rose, Haider, and Urban forced the&nbsp; beam through a second hexapole , one that worked&nbsp;&nbsp; the opposite way, so it would unbend the&nbsp; distorted image back into a circular shape. But now they, calculated this&nbsp; new image might have the remnants&nbsp;&nbsp; of that tiny divergence still in its center, with&nbsp; spherical aberration pointing in the opposite way. So if they got their maths and engineering&nbsp; exactly right, they could feed an image with&nbsp;&nbsp; spherical aberration through these two lenses&nbsp; to almost completely counteract the effect. And I imagine a lot of people in the field thought&nbsp; it was a crazy idea when it was proposed, right? Not only the concept, but, that this is,&nbsp; like, technically feasible, I believe.&nbsp; It was thought that this is not possible. By May 1997, the group had just two months of&nbsp;&nbsp; development time left before their&nbsp; last sponsor withdrew their backing. And to make matters worse, their latest lens&nbsp; iteration was still just on the drawing board. But somehow, by the 23rd of July,&nbsp;&nbsp; just a week before their funding ran&nbsp; out, the new lens was ready to test. They gingerly placed it into the microscope,&nbsp;&nbsp; but like every time before it,&nbsp; the lens was unstable and failed. So they decided to switch off the equipment&nbsp; for 24 hours to allow the magnets to settle. And then at 2 a.m. on the&nbsp; 24th, they turned it on again,&nbsp;&nbsp; and almost magically, the&nbsp; picture started to stabilize. Suddenly, there was no aberration.&nbsp; Only beautiful, clear images of atoms. After more than 60 years of failed attempts,&nbsp;&nbsp; Urban, Rose, and Haider pulled&nbsp; off the seemingly impossible. With this method, they cut the resolution&nbsp; of the TEM down to only 0.13 nanometers. An average TEM image went from&nbsp; looking like this to this. A few months after the group's breakthrough,&nbsp;&nbsp; Knut Urban attended a microscopy&nbsp; conference to share these results. But because of the group's reputation,&nbsp;&nbsp; he was relegated to a small back&nbsp; room that barely anyone noticed. Soon, however, word spread that against all odds,&nbsp;&nbsp; his pictures seemed real. Then&nbsp; a crowd of hundreds formed. People were lining up outside, hoping to get&nbsp; a glimpse of their stunningly sharp images. So we're going to get a sample holder. Yeah, so we got a sample holder out. We put that under the optical microscope. So the sample itself is a small lamella that&nbsp; you can't see without the optical microscope. Yeah. Have a look through that. Beautiful. On top of the B there's&nbsp; a prong. Yeah. And on the very top&nbsp;&nbsp; of that on the left-hand side,&nbsp; looks like a little bit of dust. That's our actual sample. Okay, now I simply go up with the magnification&nbsp; and I do a very few, like, more basic alignments.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this electron microscope because it's&nbsp; called transmission electron microscope, the electrons always transmit the sample. Here we&nbsp; look through our entire sample at the same time. And that's why it's so important&nbsp; that we align the sample. If you imagine atoms in a high-symmetry&nbsp; direction are lined up like pearls on a string. When we look down it, well, we can see an image. But if we are in, like, some random direction&nbsp; that everything would be just blurred. So that's why we have to do&nbsp; some tilting in the edge. And this is where the actual sample&nbsp; starts — the strontium titanate. And this is a thin region where we&nbsp; hope to get atomic resolution. So this is 5000 times? Yes Wow. And we see strontium, titanium. We see&nbsp; oxygen. We see carbon. That's contamination. So most likely what we're looking&nbsp; at is carbon contamination. When you do this focus, what&nbsp; are you really looking for? I look for this edge to become sharp. See atoms. What? Just like that. That's wild. &nbsp; Shortly after, the group successfully corrected&nbsp; &nbsp; Orndrej Krivanek independently achieved&nbsp;&nbsp; the same for Crewe’s version of&nbsp; the microscope, the scanning TEM. And in 2020, all four were awarded&nbsp; the prestigious Kavli Prize in&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanoscience for accomplishing what&nbsp; so many others thought impossible. Through their persistence and ingenuity,&nbsp; seeing atoms like this is, well, normal. How big of a difference does&nbsp; aberration correction make? If you want to see atoms and if you want to,&nbsp; for example, measure in atomic distances,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you want to learn what type of atoms&nbsp; you have, you need aberration correction. Any research that's material science.&nbsp; Materials engineering, chemical engineering... You need to see what's happening at the atomic&nbsp;&nbsp;level because you want to relate&nbsp; the properties to the structure. If you can't see the structure at the atomic&nbsp; level, you only have half of the information. So that was a game changer. That's why nowadays every university in&nbsp; principle needs a microscope like that.
