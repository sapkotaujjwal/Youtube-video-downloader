00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.650
427 days into what should have been a 30-day mission, and it's turned into a nightmare.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.490
On the surface of Mars, 297 million kilometers away is Ingenuity, a tiny 680 gram helicopter.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.670
It's made from off-the-shelf parts you'd find at home.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.609
It's got bits from an Android smartphone, batteries from a cordless drill, and to everyone's surprise, it's been performing well so far.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.010
But something is wrong.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.290
See, the Martian winter is coming.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.409
At night, temperatures plummet to a frigid negative 85 degrees celsius.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.409
As Mars gets further away from the sun, the temperature keeps dropping, and it kicks up more and more violent dust.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.209
The sun is blotted from the sky.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.030
On her 427th day on Mars, they try to reach her, just like the day before, but they get no response.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.669
They try again, nothing.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.304
Back on Earth the team gathers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:02.840
All the signs point to Ingenuity being dead.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.019
But there is still one thing, one final trick that can try to reestablish a connection.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.319
The first drone that's gonna fly on another planet.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.119
Six years ago, I visited JPL and saw Ingenuity before she left for Mars.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
At the time, NASA didn't really believe much in her mission.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.953
As Kenneth Farley, the project scientist of the Mars 2020 Perseverance mission said,

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.909
I've personally been opposed to it...

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.230
Spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further the goals directly from the science point of view.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.509
In short, they thought it was a waste of time.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.790
Most projects to Mars get billions of dollars.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
Ingenuity got only 80 million, which is less than the budget of the movie The Martian.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.270
But this scrappy team of scientists were working to prove a crazy concept.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.939
And against the odds, they made it to Mars.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.219
On February 18th, 2021, the Perseverance Rover survives entry and lands on the Martian surface.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.779
Attached underneath is Ingenuity.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.499
This marks Sol Zero, her first day on Mars.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.400
They sever the umbilical cord and Ingenuity, affectionately known as Ginny by some on the team, prepares herself.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.039
Her mission is simple.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.999
Prove that flight on the red planet is possible.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350
But with an atmosphere just 1% that of Earth, flying is really difficult.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.589
She must be ultra light, and her blades must spin at over 2,400 rotations per minute to generate enough lift.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.590
It's a design that no one is really sure about.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.509
For two months, they rigorously check her systems, running up the engine, testing navigation, and her control computer.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.130
Then, on Sol 58, they finally think they're ready.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.616
The blades spin up. And...

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.380
she takes off, only 120 years after the Wright brothers on Earth.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.519
Humanity flies on another planet.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.849
Within days, they fly again, and then again, and again.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.349
In just one month, they complete five flights.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.970
So the mission has been accomplished.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.229
We were a tech demo, right, meaning a specified, narrow, 30-sol mission.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.530
Um, get in, get out, we're done, right?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.470
We go to a bar and party and that should be the end of it.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.880
But with success,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.639
comes new expectations.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.379
NASA tells them to keep going.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.520
Ingenuity's new mission is to assist Perseverance in the search for evidence of ancient life on Mars.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.020
So she will scout ahead, gathering data in areas too risky or costly for the rover to explore.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.668
For the team, this is great news, but it's also a problem.

00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:03.569
- There was no guarantee, you know, after flight five, we may be dead by flight seven, right?

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.830
We may be dead by flight 10.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.399
We were kind of thrown into the deep end of the pool.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.119
We had no processes or no plans developed for such a thing.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.440
Until now, every flight had been carefully planned.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.420
They've all started from an area selected and analyzed by both satellites and the Perseverance Rover itself.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.759
These flights were tested hundreds of times in JPL's wind tunnel, and tens of thousands of times in simulation.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.319
But now that they have to keep up with the rover, they're flying into the unknown.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.359
Now, flying the helicopter isn't easy.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.859
At its closest, Mars is 56 million kilometers from Earth. Which means,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.356
there's at least a six minute round trip communications time delay,

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:50.789
which is way longer than Ingenuity's two&nbsp;minute maximum flight time.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.250
So she has to fly autonomously.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.130
So what happens is the pilot programs in a route, and Ginny does the rest.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.589
But to start, JPL first needs to know exactly where she's located.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.790
You might think that they would use GPS, but for GPS to work on earth, you need at least 24 satellites for full coverage.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.360
And around Mars, there are only seven satellites total, so Ingenuity can't use this method.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.220
So instead what she does is far simpler.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.640
We have two cameras, a forward facing 13 megapixel camera, and then the one pointing down is the one that we use to navigate.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.779
The navigation camera takes 30 black and white images per second.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.200
Ingenuity's computer analyzes the image and identifies features on the surface.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.220
You can think of it sort of like an optical mouse.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.359
Like your optical mouse is on the mouse pad.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.380
It doesn't know where on the mouse pad it is, but when you move to the right, it knows you moved to the right.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.040
Because what it's doing is it's looking at features on the surface of the mouse pad and watching them move under its field of view.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.139
So Ingenuity is essentially doing the same thing.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:05.040
It's looking at the surface, it's picking out features like rocks and other things, and between camera images it says, oh, this rock moved this way, this thing over here moved this way, and from that you can compute a transform,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.060
to say my helicopter was here and now it's here relative to this image.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.169
Now this sounds good, but the method isn't 100% reliable.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.999
On Flight 6, the first time she leaves her testing area, Ingenuity detects an error.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.959
54 seconds into the flight, she starts wobbling wildly, tilting 20 degrees at a time.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.259
Her emergency alarms blare.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:39.640
We had black and white image, black and white image, black and white image, and we had a colored image come very closely to where that black and white image occurred in time.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.579
This color camera was added late in development, leaving little time for testing.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.879
And during this flight, one of the images arrives at the exact same moment as a black and white image.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.620
The system doesn't know what to do, so it drops the black and white image.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.300
This makes every following image one step behind.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.540
This means Ingenuity's cameras are giving her outdated information.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.980
So even when she's in the right spot, the computer thinks she's lagging behind and pushes her forward.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.769
So she overshoots, tilts too far, and then has to overcorrect in the other direction.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.830
This cycle repeats, making her wobble worse in a positive feedback loop.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.750
Now that is a problem, but it isn't fatal.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.990
The desyncing issue was like one camera frame off.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.010
If it had been more than that, I think you can imagine.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.629
imagine that it might have death spiraled.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.490
Instead, Ginny detects the problem and is able to emergency land before it gets too ugly.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.870
While safely on the ground, JPL discovers the error and quickly corrects it with a software patch.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.470
It's a close call, but they recover.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.790
Over the next dozen flights, they keep up with the rover and support the mission.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.170
That is, until Flight 19.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:06.029
We were about to fly that 19th flight, and I got a phone call the afternoon before, basically saying there's a dust storm brewing near Jezero crater.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.290
So we quickly canceled the flight and said well we're just going to hunker down and see what happens.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.089
They brace for impact.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.769
It lasts six days, with winds gusting up to 20 meters per second.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.429
That first dust storm in the middle of fall, the first Martian year that we were on the surface, it clobbered us.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.299
But... they make it through.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.200
Nervously, they try to make contact, and she survived.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.880
She hasn't died or toppled over, but now they have a new problem. Dust.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.739
Dust on Mars is no joke.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.240
I mean, for Ginny, there are two big problems.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.700
First, dust is covering her solar panels, reducing power by 18%.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.700
And second, it's clogging her mechanical components.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.659
We went to go fly, and when we went to wiggle the servos, they were actually stuck.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.259
They were kind of jammed from the dust.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.580
So that aborted the first attempt at flight 19.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.570
Now JPL had anticipated both of these problems, but they hadn't had the time or budget to fix them.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.469
So for the first, they just have to accept that they have reduced solar power and they adjust their flight durations accordingly.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:34.669
For the second, they find a workaround by repeatedly wiggling the servos until the joints clear.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:41.249
So she's able to keep flying, albeit wounded, and survival isn't getting any easier.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.309
See, every Martian night, the temperature drops precipitously.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.549
My friend Alex from the channel Astrum describes it well.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.070
With less atmosphere, Mars became far worse at retaining heat.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.970
When the surface starts to cool, there is no air to catch the escaping warmth.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:11.749
It is at the point where, if you were to stand on the planet's equator during its warmest time of the day, your feet might feel 23°C, while at your head, it would be 0°C.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.289
This means between day and night, Mars has some intense temperature swings.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:27.039
Temperatures there now range from highs of around 27°C down to a freezing minus 133°C at night.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:36.120
If you want to learn more about how this leads to entire planet-covering dust storms, Astrum has a whole video on the Martian climate.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.779
So these massive shifts in temperature are happening all the time.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.819
But as Ginny's mission progresses, Mars gets farther away from the Sun and enters the Martian winter.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.620
So it gets even colder at night, which is a problem.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.920
Many of Ingenuity's key electrical components are hand-soldered.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.519
And big temperature swings cause expansion and contraction of this metal, and so that can eventually break these connections.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:12.440
Also, inside the batteries, a liquid electrolyte solution allows lithium ions to move between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.240
But if this solution freezes, JPL fears that the whole thing will stop working entirely.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:25.999
So what they do is keep all the components sensitive to the cold inside a warm box, which has resistance heaters that run during the night.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:35.249
You might spend 25 or 30% of your battery flying and the other 60 to 75% is all just staying warm at night.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.429
The problem is, the colder it gets, the harder the heaters have to work.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.870
And if they can't keep up, and the batteries cool too much, they become less efficient.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.730
So they supply even less power to the heaters.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.929
Performance can continue to degrade in a vicious death spiral.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.750
On the morning of May 3rd, the team at JPL goes about a normal day.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.330
They check the data from the previous downlink?

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.910
Nothing.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.529
They try pinging ingenuity?

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.170
Still nothing.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.950
Have they finally lost her?

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.970
Did we just lose our $70 million helicopter on Mars?

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.170
Is this the end of the mission?

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.810
We thought this was it.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.629
So let's just make sure, before we close the door on ingenuity, we've thought of everything.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.530
Just keep working through it.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.710
They run through all the possible problems until they narrow it down to just one.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.289
The way she was designed, Ginny has an alarm clock that wakes her up.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.440
It stays awake for 15 minutes.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.040
If it doesn't hear anything after 15 minutes, it goes back to sleep, and it doesn't wake up until the next alarm.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.230
Their hypothesis is this:

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:51.690
if the lack of sunlight forced Jenny to fully deplete her batteries, then during the night her heaters would have stopped and she would have powered off completely.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:58.510
When the sun rises, as long as her essential components still function, she may recharge enough to wake up.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.929
Only now her clock will have reset.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.750
So they run the calculations.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:10.789
If she's still alive based on when the sun comes up, she should be waking up at 11:45 a.m.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.940
Martian time.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.360
That is not the time they had been trying.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.240
So they change their search window and start calling out to Ginny around when they expect her to power up.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.720
They send out ping after ping until finally...

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.780
she's alive!

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.789
They check to see whether everything is still working.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:39.349
And despite the components in her warm box only being rated to negative 45 degrees, they survive being completely frozen.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.470
Well, all except for one.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.730
The inclinometer is dead.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:50.049
The inclinometer is what lets Ingenuity know her physical orientation in 3D space before flight.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.330
And that is pretty essential for getting the right heading.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.870
You can imagine if you're off in heading by 10 degrees, you could fly into a mountain.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.059
Without the inclinometer, there is no way for her to fly.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:11.740
So at first, the whole team is stumped, but then they have an idea because Ingenuity is made of phone parts, literally parts from phones people carry around every day.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.639
Her processor is from a Samsung Galaxy S5, and some of her sensors are from a Google Pixel 3.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.400
And these phones can do a lot of the things that an inclinometer can do.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:30.759
Inside every smartphone are at least three little micro-electromechanical systems aligned perpendicular to each other, like x, y, z.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.820
At their core is a small mass suspended by flexible arms.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:42.440
They work like springs and follow Hooke's law, F = -kx, where force is proportional to displacement.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.419
The mass also follows Newton's second law, F = ma.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.019
If you combine these equations, you get a = -kx/m.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.580
which links acceleration and displacement.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.220
Surrounding the mass are fixed arms.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:08.100
When a voltage is applied to the mass and arms, they form a capacitor, where epsilon and A stay constant, but as the mass moves, the distance between them changes with x.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:15.559
This alters the capacitance, which becomes more noticeable with multiple plates, hence why they have so many little arms.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.139
By measuring capacitance, you can determine displacement.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:25.429
And since displacement is proportional to acceleration, changes in capacitance allow us to measure acceleration.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:33.690
That's why these devices are called accelerometers, and by integrating acceleration over time, you can work out velocity and then position.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.970
This is how motion tracking works for screen rotation, gaming controls, and step counting.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:48.150
If you add gyroscopes, you get an inertial measurement unit, or IMU, and Ingenuity has the same IMU as the Google Pixel 3.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.860
So the team at JPL had an idea.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.259
They could reprogram the computer to use the IMU to replace the inclinometer.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:06.640
The inclinometer is really just accelerometers that allows us to tell the initial attitude of the vehicle in roll and pitch.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.519
And the IMU also has accelerometers, so in principle it gives you the same information.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.710
So from the clutches of failure, they get her running again.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.419
We got lucky in that the one instrument we could afford to lose was the one that died.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.210
But the IMU isn't space-grade.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.909
In fact, none of these off-the-shelf parts are, which means they're vulnerable to cosmic rays.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.129
On Mars, the thin atmosphere doesn't just make it harder to fly.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:46.390
It also means cosmic rays reach the surface more easily, and a single cosmic ray can strike a computer register and flip a bit inside the computer, which can lead to some strange behavior.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.850
It even happens here on Earth.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:53.789
It once added 4,096 unaccounted votes to a candidate in a Belgian election.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:17:00.409
Now on a Martian helicopter, flipping the wrong bit at the wrong time could mean losing control and crashing.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.729
So why doesn't that happen? 
If you'd asked

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:10.419
somebody 10 years ago can you fly just the latest cell phone processor they'd be like no it'll last like two days and you'll be dead right

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:16.328
It turns out that cosmic ray bit flips are not as big a deal as NASA thought.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:20.430
The off-the-shelf components hold up way better than they expected.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.689
And this is an important finding.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:29.950
Rather than going through all of the development cost of building up a processor from scratch to be radiation tolerant,

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:36.770
our finding is you get a lot better bang for your buck by just going and basically buying batches of different processors and just qualling them.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.580
That means throw them through a radiation test campaign, look at the failure rates, figuring out,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.330
hey, this guy, we don't know why, but for whatever reason, this processor over here is great.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.430
It holds up, so we'll fly that.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.709
Now, using these surprisingly robust off-the-shelf parts, they survive the rest of the winter,

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:58.309
but they're only barely able to stay within the communication range of the rover.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.830
-Springtime came.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.220
-Yeah.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.360
-The birds were chirping on the...

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.599
-Talk about spring optimism, right?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960
Like coming out of winter.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.589
With the increased sunlight, they can now fully recharge and return to their scientific mission.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.109
Over the next 41 flights, they image craters Perseverance can't make it to.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.950
They capture stunning images of the Martian horizon from above.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.950
they conduct daring aerodynamic tests and they begin to push the limits.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:31.849
They want to fly faster, but the faster they go, the quicker features move across the camera's field of view.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.469
And the vision navigation system just can't keep up with that.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.950
So JPL comes up with a solution.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.390
They fly higher.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:45.150
Then they can expand the field of view, which means features will move more slowly through frame.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:51.515
So, from an initial goal of a 10 meter altitude, they go up to 24 meters, and as a result,

00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:57.140
they're able to go from flying at 2 meters per second all the way up to 10 meters per second.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:04.100
Speed records, distance records, altitude records, just everything we could think of to push that flight envelope on Ingenuity,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.970
really make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of having a helicopter on Mars.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.719
Everything is going swimmingly.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.260
Ginny and Perseverance have made it all the way to Nuretva Vallis, a river delta in Jezero Crater.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:24.759
But on Flight 71, there's a new problem, and it's worse than any of the ones that came before.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:32.460
Now, Ingenuity's only scientific payload is a camera, so she's taking hundreds of photos a day and sending them to JPL.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.900
And she's not alone.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.600
Perseverance does the same, including this selfie with Ingenuity.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.730
Honestly, they're the most chronically online duo on Mars.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.349
We always know exactly where they are, what they're up to, and they're constantly sharing photos.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.089
But really, how different is that from us?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.529
I mean, we spend most of our lives online, constantly sharing data.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.010
Except in our case, that data doesn't just sit in a NASA archive.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.689
It gets bought, sold, and used in ways we're not always aware of.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.010
That's why I've been using today's sponsor, Incogni.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.370
I created my account a year ago, and since then they've filed over 300 requests on my behalf,

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.490
resulting in my data being removed from over 100 marketing and spam databases.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:21.890
If I tried to do that myself, it would have taken around 230 hours, literally weeks of work.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.479
That is time I can better spend making videos, which I'm sure you appreciate.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.119
So to try Incogni, visit incogni.com/veritasium.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.520
I want to thank Incogni for sponsoring this part of the video.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.380
And now back to Ingenuity.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.039
So we just had this one final thing to do.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.119
We needed to cross this sand dune and make it to Bright Angel to rendezvous with the rover.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.020
So on 71, we basically went up.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.460
We were flying.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.440
And then after about 10 seconds of flying with degraded navigation, we went into an emergency landing mode and sort of came down hard.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.329
They hailed Ginny and luckily she's still alive.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.910
In the error code they discover the problem.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:26.490
As she was flying over the dunes there just weren't enough rocks or landmarks for her camera to identify

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:32.730
and without those references she quickly lost track of her position and had to make an emergency landing.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.869
It's similar to the camera issue from flight 6 but this time there's no software fix.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.571
They check for structural damage

00:21:42.774 --> 00:21:45.207
but suprisingly everything is still intact.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.358
So they attempt another flight, this time going straight up to scan the surroundings and then coming straight back down. Simple.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.900
We popped up, took pictures, and then on the way back down, we hit the same problems we did on 71.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.100
Only this time, it's fatal.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.160
Perseverance drives over and captures this image of her crash site.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:16.030
When we saw the blades broken, when we saw that first image after flight 72, that was heart wrenching.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.529
It was like, no, there's no way this mission can continue.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.849
That was very depressing.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.770
So why?

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.729
Because 71 was also a crash landing for the same reasons.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:38.250
It was, you know, the NASA system was confused and drove us into the ground, but we came out of that apparently unscathed, and yet on 72, we self-destructed.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.979
This is the first air crash investigation on another planet, right?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.500
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:48.855
First aircraft on another planet and then the first air crash investigation kind of go hand in hand.

00:22:48.855 --> 00:22:55.210
At the crash site, they find Ingenuity's blades scattered, but not in the way they expect.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.000
We noticed something interesting, which was there was no blade strike spot.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.179
Blades spinning this fast, when they hit the ground, right, they're going to create a spray.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.720
There's going to be a pattern, probably even visible from orbit, and we didn't see anything like that.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.429
So if the blades didn't strike the ground, then what happened?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.539
So this is an actual prototype blade from the development phase.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.539
This is essentially identical to the blades on Ingenuity.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.160
It's a carbon fiber composite with a foam core.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.359
It's incredibly light, if you want to feel it.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360
Yeah.
- Woah! 

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.219
That's actually great.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.640
That's like at least a quarter of what I expected just looking at it.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.920
It doesn't feel physical.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.390
So why did they break?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:42.470
Well, as the blades spin, the tips of the blades trace out a circle, which you can think of like a hula hoop.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:49.109
If there's a force up on the near side, you might expect the rotor to tilt immediately in this direction.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.990
But that is not actually what happens.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.790
See, the blade isn't stationary, it's moving really fast.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.549
So when you apply this force, it actually only moves after that point.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.949
So the maximum displacement occurs 90 degrees later.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.239
So, even though we push up on the near side, the blades tilt up on the right and down on the left.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.480
This effect is called precession, and it's the same principle that explains this spinning bike wheel demonstration.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.820
Now, Ingenuity has a second set of blades that are moving in the opposite direction.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:27.319
Which means that, when a force is applied, each set of blades experiences precession in the opposite direction.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.999
For the helicopter overall, these torques cancel out,

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.269
but each individual blade still flexes because of that precession torque.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.099
That results in a stress concentration right about here where that final reinforcement tapers off.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.579
And so if you had a procession-based failure, you'd expect it to fail right here.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.339
And sure enough, that's exactly where you see it in the pictures.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.259
You can see sort of this jaggy place where the blade tip just got ripped off.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.489
So that is what happened on Flight 72.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.069
As Ginny came down hard, she hit a dune at an angle.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:11.728
The force was transmitted up through the body of the helicopter, and this created a procession torque that bent the rotors, and they snapped right where the reinforcement tapers down.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.200
This thing came down hard.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.860
It didn't destroy the landing gear.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.440
It didn't break the avionics.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.720
It didn't kill the servos.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.240
The swash plates are all fine.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320
They're all intact.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.820
It's the rotors.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.080
That's the weak link.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.769
So that is the first thing they're changing on the next generation of Mars helicopter, which is called Chopper.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.929
You had a chance to hold the Ingenuity blade.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.509
This is the next-gen baby blade.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.930
It looks fairly similar with a couple of key differences.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.650
They reinforced the blades to withstand the torques caused by hard landings.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:53.309
Now they also have six rotors instead of two, which means Chopper can hold a lot, even carrying a scientific payload of its own.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.040
We've developed now a very lightweight radio that can communicate directly to orbit.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:58.880
Woah.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.400
So we're a free bird when it comes to exploring the planet now.
-That's huge, that's huge!

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.099
You were sort of trying to trail perseverance, right, and now you can go anywhere.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.530
Yep, we're our own spacecraft.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:14.450
In this blue box, you can shove about five kilograms of science payload and bring it anywhere on the planet on Mars.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.610
You can fly three kilometers per sol in a matter of minutes.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.730
That's really generated a lot of excitement in the science community.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.109
So this is a fifth scale model of Chopper.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.609
It's really two systems.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.789
So this is our Chopper platform, right?

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.410
This is what's going to go on and explore the entire surface of Mars one day.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.289
That's the point of the concept.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.290
But underneath,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.390
is a mid-air helicopter delivery platform.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:45.009
See, Mars rovers all need complex sky cranes to land, but a helicopter is different.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.349
It just needs a platform to take off from.

00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:55.767
So the idea is we come down through the atmosphere, we have this jet pack that we need to slow us down to get us down to a regime that is controllable

00:26:56.644 --> 00:27:02.120
so that we can take off from that platform midair and land under our own power.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.109
For this, it needs rockets.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.809
3, 2, 1...

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:21.119
Awesome! 
You're envisioning like a future of aviation all over Mars as a primary explorative.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.309
In my mind, it's absolutely going to happen in just a matter of time.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.249
There will be fleets flying, you know, throughout Mars.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:36.310
There will be airports on Mars one day, and we'll have aircraft the size of Chopper, more aircraft the size of Ingenuity, and even bigger than Chopper.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:42.570
NASA is thinking big thanks to Ingenuity, a project they once doubted.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.930
Because Ginny showed what is possible.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:53.770
In 1890, if you had said, I'm gonna fly, it's like, okay, that kooky guy in his garage, he thinks he can fly, he's gonna kill himself, right?

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.390
After the Wright brothers, it's like, oh, okay, yeah, this is the thing that we're gonna do.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.690
And so that's the change in mentality that's occurred because of engineering.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:11.609
That's why, still sitting there on the surface of Mars, attached to the underside of Ingenuity is a tiny scrap, one square centimeter of muslin fabric.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:17.570
It was taken from the lower left wing of the first airplane, the right flyer.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.310
From the first flight on Earth, to the first flight on another planet.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.769
From Ingenuity's grave on Mars, her spirit lives on.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:30.790
Except...

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.209
she isn't quite dead yet.

00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:39.665
She's acting as a weather station now, capturing photos every day, capturing temperature measurements every day, something no one would

00:28:39.896 --> 00:28:45.536
have ever predicted&nbsp;before flight 72 that if things don't go well, we just still have a functioning spacecraft.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.390
So she's a tank.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.550
The team couldn't be more proud of what Ingenuity's accomplished.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600
Thanks for watching.
