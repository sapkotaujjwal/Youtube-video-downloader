WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en you chose option e on the rebound you chose option e on the rebound you chose option e on the rebound unfortunately this is not where unfortunately this is not where unfortunately this is not where acceleration is greatest a lot of people acceleration is greatest a lot of people acceleration is greatest a lot of people confuse velocity and acceleration confuse velocity and acceleration confuse velocity and acceleration velocity is how fast something goes velocity is how fast something goes velocity is how fast something goes while acceleration is the rate at which while acceleration is the rate at which while acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes velocity changes velocity changes after hitting his lowest point the after hitting his lowest point the after hitting his lowest point the jumper starts speeding up upwards but as jumper starts speeding up upwards but as jumper starts speeding up upwards but as the Bungie recoils then he starts the Bungie recoils then he starts the Bungie recoils then he starts accelerating down again these accelerating down again these accelerating down again these accelerations are not the greatest of accelerations are not the greatest of accelerations are not the greatest of the jump however
