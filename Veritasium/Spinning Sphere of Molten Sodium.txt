backup the wrong tree let's back up and backup the wrong tree let's back up and explain what is this thing this is a explain what is this thing this is a explain what is this thing this is a three meter sphere of molten sodium that three meter sphere of molten sodium that three meter sphere of molten sodium that is 12.5 tons of hot liquid metal is 12.5 tons of hot liquid metal is 12.5 tons of hot liquid metal designed to span it up to four designed to span it up to four designed to span it up to four revolutions per second and at that rate revolutions per second and at that rate revolutions per second and at that rate the outer surface of the sphere is the outer surface of the sphere is the outer surface of the sphere is moving at over a hundred and thirty moving at over a hundred and thirty moving at over a hundred and thirty kilometers an hour kilometers an hour kilometers an hour that's over 80 miles per hour basically that's over 80 miles per hour basically that's over 80 miles per hour basically it's representing the earth what they're it's representing the earth what they're it's representing the earth what they're trying to do is find out how the Earth's trying to do is find out how the Earth's trying to do is find out how the Earth's magnetic field is generated and some of magnetic field is generated and some of magnetic field is generated and some of the first scientists to study this the first scientists to study this the first scientists to study this starting with William Gilbert in 1600 starting with William Gilbert in 1600 starting with William Gilbert in 1600 proposed that the earth was a huge proposed that the earth was a huge proposed that the earth was a huge permanent magnet now today we know that permanent magnet now today we know that permanent magnet now today we know that the inner core of the earth is solid and the inner core of the earth is solid and the inner core of the earth is solid and it's mostly made up of iron and nickel it's mostly made up of iron and nickel it's mostly made up of iron and nickel which are ferromagnetic elements however which are ferromagnetic elements however which are ferromagnetic elements however the temperature of the inner core is the temperature of the inner core is the temperature of the inner core is nearly 6,000 Kelvin which is way above nearly 6,000 Kelvin which is way above nearly 6,000 Kelvin which is way above their Curie temperatures and so there is their Curie temperatures and so there is their Curie temperatures and so there is no way that they could maintain a no way that they could maintain a no way that they could maintain a permanent magnetic field the same is permanent magnetic field the same is permanent magnetic field the same is true of the solid mantle of the earth true of the solid mantle of the earth true of the solid mantle of the earth much of it is way too hot for permanent much of it is way too hot for permanent much of it is way too hot for permanent magnets which leaves only the liquid magnets which leaves only the liquid magnets which leaves only the liquid metal outer core as the place where metal outer core as the place where metal outer core as the place where Earth's magnetic fields could be Earth's magnetic fields could be Earth's magnetic fields could be generated and this is what is modeled by generated and this is what is modeled by generated and this is what is modeled by the 3-meter spinning sphere of molten the 3-meter spinning sphere of molten the 3-meter spinning sphere of molten sodium it needs to be as large as sodium it needs to be as large as sodium it needs to be as large as practicable it needs to be as high-speed practicable it needs to be as high-speed practicable it needs to be as high-speed as practicable and we use liquid sodium as practicable and we use liquid sodium as practicable and we use liquid sodium because it's the best electric conductor because it's the best electric conductor because it's the best electric conductor of any liquid so it has the downsides of of any liquid so it has the downsides of of any liquid so it has the downsides of being hazardous and flammable but the being hazardous and flammable but the being hazardous and flammable but the failure would be modestly Cass trophic failure would be modestly Cass trophic failure would be modestly Cass trophic it's gonna weird twist a phrase but it's it's gonna weird twist a phrase but it's it's gonna weird twist a phrase but it's modestly catice most buildings have modestly catice most buildings have modestly catice most buildings have sprinkler systems in case of fire but sprinkler systems in case of fire but sprinkler systems in case of fire but not this lab to see why take a look at not this lab to see why take a look at not this lab to see why take a look at a single drop of water falling on a a single drop of water falling on a a single drop of water falling on a single drop of molten sodium now single drop of molten sodium now single drop of molten sodium now multiply that by 12.5 tonnes and you multiply that by 12.5 tonnes and you multiply that by 12.5 tonnes and you have modestly catastrophic but the have modestly catastrophic but the have modestly catastrophic but the researchers have thought about this and researchers have thought about this and researchers have thought about this and they have a plan there is a liquid they have a plan there is a liquid they have a plan there is a liquid nitrogen Dewar that sits up top so one nitrogen Dewar that sits up top so one nitrogen Dewar that sits up top so one of these mostly full you can just hit a of these mostly full you can just hit a of these mostly full you can just hit a switch and dump the entire contents switch and dump the entire contents switch and dump the entire contents liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen liquid nitrogen top of the experiment so this is like a top of the experiment so this is like a top of the experiment so this is like a physicist super fire extinguisher then physicist super fire extinguisher then physicist super fire extinguisher then you know it's back-up plan the plan is you know it's back-up plan the plan is you know it's back-up plan the plan is no leak no fire the back-up plan no leak no fire the back-up plan no leak no fire the back-up plan put the fire out with cryogenics it put the fire out with cryogenics it put the fire out with cryogenics it actually works great this is three actually works great this is three actually works great this is three hundred degrees colder than the sodium hundred degrees colder than the sodium hundred degrees colder than the sodium and so sodium cannot burn nitrogen gas and so sodium cannot burn nitrogen gas and so sodium cannot burn nitrogen gas atmosphere and the cold freezes it and atmosphere and the cold freezes it and atmosphere and the cold freezes it and leak gets frozen and everything just leak gets frozen and everything just leak gets frozen and everything just chills but when everything's working chills but when everything's working chills but when everything's working normally how is a spinning sphere of normally how is a spinning sphere of normally how is a spinning sphere of liquid metal meant to generate a liquid metal meant to generate a liquid metal meant to generate a magnetic field well for the earth the magnetic field well for the earth the magnetic field well for the earth the thinking goes like this first as the thinking goes like this first as the thinking goes like this first as the earth radiates heat into space its core earth radiates heat into space its core earth radiates heat into space its core cools this means the solid inner core is cools this means the solid inner core is cools this means the solid inner core is growing as iron and nickel from the growing as iron and nickel from the growing as iron and nickel from the outer core solidify at the boundary now outer core solidify at the boundary now outer core solidify at the boundary now this leaves some lighter elements like this leaves some lighter elements like this leaves some lighter elements like sulfur for example behind in the outer sulfur for example behind in the outer sulfur for example behind in the outer core and so patches with those lighter core and so patches with those lighter core and so patches with those lighter elements experience a buoyant force and elements experience a buoyant force and elements experience a buoyant force and rise away from the court in turbulent rise away from the court in turbulent rise away from the court in turbulent convection currents now add to this the convection currents now add to this the convection currents now add to this the fact that the earth is rotating the fact that the earth is rotating the fact that the earth is rotating the rotation causes those convection rotation causes those convection rotation causes those convection currents to spiral around and access currents to spiral around and access currents to spiral around and access roughly parallel with the Earth's axis roughly parallel with the Earth's axis roughly parallel with the Earth's axis of rotation of rotation of rotation these spiraling turbulent flows of these spiraling turbulent flows of these spiraling turbulent flows of liquid metal can trap magnetic field liquid metal can trap magnetic field liquid metal can trap magnetic field lines and as they move and stretch the lines and as they move and stretch the lines and as they move and stretch the field they create electric currents that field they create electric currents that field they create electric currents that produce more magnetic fields if the produce more magnetic fields if the produce more magnetic fields if the magnetic fields are generated faster magnetic fields are generated faster magnetic fields are generated faster than they dissipate due to the than they dissipate due to the than they dissipate due to the resistance of the metal well then you resistance of the metal well then you resistance of the metal well then you have a self-sustaining electric have a self-sustaining electric have a self-sustaining electric generator or a dynamo we talk about the generator or a dynamo we talk about the generator or a dynamo we talk about the dynamo generation of magnetic fields to dynamo generation of magnetic fields to dynamo generation of magnetic fields to mean when you have a turbulent conductor mean when you have a turbulent conductor mean when you have a turbulent conductor let's say convecting like the core let's say convecting like the core let's say convecting like the core that's spontaneously generates a that's spontaneously generates a that's spontaneously generates a magnetic field if you have a little bit magnetic field if you have a little bit magnetic field if you have a little bit of current that happens it causes a of current that happens it causes a of current that happens it causes a little bit of magnetic field that little bit of magnetic field that little bit of magnetic field that couples into the motion couples into the motion couples into the motion that causes more currents cause more that causes more currents cause more that causes more currents cause more magnetic fields couples into the motion magnetic fields couples into the motion magnetic fields couples into the motion and then you're just converting motion and then you're just converting motion and then you're just converting motion to currents but it goes it goes unstable to currents but it goes it goes unstable to currents but it goes it goes unstable it's kind of counterintuitive though it's kind of counterintuitive though it's kind of counterintuitive though because you started out with no magnetic because you started out with no magnetic because you started out with no magnetic field so how do you get the current in field so how do you get the current in field so how do you get the current in the first place you don't I mean like no the first place you don't I mean like no the first place you don't I mean like no no oh you know all you need is a little no oh you know all you need is a little no oh you know all you need is a little infinitesimal amount a thermal variation infinitesimal amount a thermal variation infinitesimal amount a thermal variation a random current will just grow to full a random current will just grow to full a random current will just grow to full size so one Sun is unstable actually you size so one Sun is unstable actually you size so one Sun is unstable actually you don't really care where the the tickle don't really care where the the tickle don't really care where the the tickle came from the states we have now don't came from the states we have now don't came from the states we have now don't generate their own magnetic field so generate their own magnetic field so generate their own magnetic field so we've not reached the dynamo threshold we've not reached the dynamo threshold we've not reached the dynamo threshold although the hope is to do so in a although the hope is to do so in a although the hope is to do so in a modified version of the experiment so we modified version of the experiment so we modified version of the experiment so we apply magnetic fields from the outside apply magnetic fields from the outside apply magnetic fields from the outside and then look at the amplification in and then look at the amplification in and then look at the amplification in those magnetic fields by the rotating those magnetic fields by the rotating those magnetic fields by the rotating turbulence and we get a copious amounts turbulence and we get a copious amounts turbulence and we get a copious amounts of amplification depending on where we of amplification depending on where we of amplification depending on where we are in the operating conditions for are in the operating conditions for are in the operating conditions for instance we apply these external instance we apply these external instance we apply these external magnetic fields sort of go through the magnetic fields sort of go through the magnetic fields sort of go through the experiment like that they get twisted up experiment like that they get twisted up experiment like that they get twisted up by the flow and the magnetic fields in by the flow and the magnetic fields in by the flow and the magnetic fields in the angular direction can be up to ten the angular direction can be up to ten the angular direction can be up to ten times larger than the fields we apply so times larger than the fields we apply so times larger than the fields we apply so we actually have lots of gain even we actually have lots of gain even we actually have lots of gain even though we've not yet have a closed loop though we've not yet have a closed loop though we've not yet have a closed loop dynamo so why is it important to dynamo so why is it important to dynamo so why is it important to understand the Earth's magnetic field we understand the Earth's magnetic field we understand the Earth's magnetic field we know the Earth's magnetic field is part know the Earth's magnetic field is part know the Earth's magnetic field is part of what makes Earth a habitable planet of what makes Earth a habitable planet of what makes Earth a habitable planet one of the ways is that it forms a one of the ways is that it forms a one of the ways is that it forms a shield the magnetosphere which deflects shield the magnetosphere which deflects shield the magnetosphere which deflects the worst parts of the solar storms the worst parts of the solar storms the worst parts of the solar storms around but lately that shield appears to around but lately that shield appears to around but lately that shield appears to be weakening so the Earth's magnetic be weakening so the Earth's magnetic be weakening so the Earth's magnetic field was dropped 10% in the last 170 field was dropped 10% in the last 170 field was dropped 10% in the last 170 years we don't know why there's a very years we don't know why there's a very years we don't know why there's a very weak spot of the Earth's magnetic field weak spot of the Earth's magnetic field weak spot of the Earth's magnetic field in the South Atlantic the South Atlantic in the South Atlantic the South Atlantic in the South Atlantic the South Atlantic anomaly that's growing weaker we do know anomaly that's growing weaker we do know anomaly that's growing weaker we do know the Earth's magnetic field has reversed the Earth's magnetic field has reversed the Earth's magnetic field has reversed many hundreds of times in its history we many hundreds of times in its history we many hundreds of times in its history we don't know where it's going now we don't know where it's going now we don't know where it's going now we actually don't currently have a actually don't currently have a actually don't currently have a predictive science of those magnetic predictive science of those magnetic predictive science of those magnetic field why is that important so the field why is that important so the field why is that important so the Earth's magnetic field has whether it Earth's magnetic field has whether it Earth's magnetic field has whether it has changes you might want to have a has changes you might want to have a has changes you might want to have a forecast for planning purposes will this forecast for planning purposes will this forecast for planning purposes will this spinning sphere make that forecasting spinning sphere make that forecasting spinning sphere make that forecasting possible it's an experiment so no one possible it's an experiment so no one possible it's an experiment so no one has run a device like this ever it's has run a device like this ever it's has run a device like this ever it's world unique so you don't entirely know world unique so you don't entirely know world unique so you don't entirely know what's gonna happen we run it but that's what's gonna happen we run it but that's what's gonna happen we run it but that's why we do experiments so in fact we why we do experiments so in fact we why we do experiments so in fact we don't know whether it's possible or not don't know whether it's possible or not don't know whether it's possible or not to predict the Earth's future to predict the Earth's future to predict the Earth's future magnetically magnetically
