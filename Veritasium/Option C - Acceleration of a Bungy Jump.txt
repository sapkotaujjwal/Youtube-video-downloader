WEBVTT Kind: captions Language: en you chose option C when the bungee you chose option C when the bungee you chose option C when the bungee jumper is going fastest I think this jumper is going fastest I think this jumper is going fastest I think this will be one of the most common answers will be one of the most common answers will be one of the most common answers but unfortunately it's also incorrect we but unfortunately it's also incorrect we but unfortunately it's also incorrect we need to make a clear distinction between need to make a clear distinction between need to make a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration velocity is velocity and acceleration velocity is velocity and acceleration velocity is how fast something's going while how fast something's going while how fast something's going while acceleration is the rate at which acceleration is the rate at which acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes when the jumper is velocity changes when the jumper is velocity changes when the jumper is going his fastest his acceleration is going his fastest his acceleration is going his fastest his acceleration is actually zero after he jumps off the actually zero after he jumps off the actually zero after he jumps off the platform he speeds up to a maximum platform he speeds up to a maximum platform he speeds up to a maximum velocity at Point C but now the Rope velocity at Point C but now the Rope velocity at Point C but now the Rope starts slowing him down so at Point C starts slowing him down so at Point C starts slowing him down so at Point C he's neither speeding up nor slowing he's neither speeding up nor slowing he's neither speeding up nor slowing down his velocity is not changing so his down his velocity is not changing so his down his velocity is not changing so his acceleration is zero
