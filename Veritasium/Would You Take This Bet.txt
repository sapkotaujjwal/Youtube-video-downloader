what I lose than what I win I think I think that's what I win I think I think that's what I win I think I think that's exactly the point because we feel losses exactly the point because we feel losses exactly the point because we feel losses more than we feel gains there's an more than we feel gains there's an more than we feel gains there's an asymmetry in the way people perceive asymmetry in the way people perceive asymmetry in the way people perceive gains and losses losses are felt much gains and losses losses are felt much gains and losses losses are felt much more intensely in fact psychologically more intensely in fact psychologically more intensely in fact psychologically most people weight a loss around twice most people weight a loss around twice most people weight a loss
